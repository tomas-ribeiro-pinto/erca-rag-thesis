The rest of the code is to track mouse movements, drawing a path based on Dijkstra's Algorithm, and live clicks (event handling) on the image to select the seeds. To get optimal results, the number of seeds matters. Fewer seeds lead to an unrefined output, as shown in Fig 3. However, more seeds give better results, as depicted in Fig 2.

The problem of efficient, interactive foreground/background seg- mentation in still images is of great practical importance in im- age editing. Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) infor- mation, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a ro- bust algorithm for “border matting” has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools.

This paper addresses the problem of efficient, interactive extrac- tion of a foreground object in a complex environment whose back- ground cannot be trivially subtracted. The resulting foreground ob- ject is an alpha-matte which reflects the proportion of foreground and background. The aim is to achieve high performance at the cost of only modest interactive effort on the part of the user. High performance in this task includes: accurate segmentation of object from background; subjectively convincing alpha values, in response to blur, mixed pixels and transparency; clean foreground colour,

In the following we describe briefly and compare several state of the art interactive tools for segmentation: Magic Wand, Intelligent Scissors, Graph Cut and Level Sets and for matting: Bayes Matting and Knockout. Fig. 2 shows their results on a matting task, together with degree of user interaction required to achieve those results.

Magic Wand _ starts with a user-specified point or region to com- ute a region of connected pixels such that all the selected pixels fall within some adjustable tolerance of the colour statistics of the specified region. While the user interface is straightforward, finding the correct tolerance level is often cumbersome and sometimes im- ossible. Fig. 2a shows the result using Magic Wand from Adobe Photoshop 7 [Adobe Systems Incorp. 2002]. Because the distri- ution in colour space of foreground and background pixels have a considerable overlap, a satisfactory segmentation is not achieved.

Intelligent Scissors (a.k.a. Live Wire or Magnetic Lasso) Mortensen and Barrett 1995] allows a user to choose a “minimum cost contour” by roughly tracing the object’s boundary with the mouse. As the mouse moves, the minimum cost path from the cur- sor position back to the last “seed” point is shown. If the computed ath deviates from the desired one, additional user-specified “seed” oints are necessary. In fig. 2b the Magnetic Lasso of Photoshop 7 was used. The main limitation of this tool is apparent: for highly texture (or un-textured) regions many alternative “minimal” paths exist. Therefore many user interactions (here 19) were necessary to obtain a satisfactory result. Snakes or Active Contours are a related approach for automatic refinement of a lasso [Kass et al. 1987].

Bayes matting models colour distributions probabilistically to achieve full alpha mattes [Chuang et al. 2001] which is based on [Ruzon and Tomasi 2000]. The user specifies a “trimap” T = {Tp,Ty ,Tr} in which background and foreground regions Tg and Tr are marked, and alpha values are computed over the remain- ing region Ty. High quality mattes can often be obtained (fig. 2c), but only when the Jy region is not too large and the back- ground/foreground colour distributions are sufficiently well sepa- rated. A considerable degree of user interaction is required to con- struct an internal and an external path.

Knockout 2 [Corel Corporation 2002] is a proprietary plug-in for Photoshop which is driven from a user-defined trimap, like Bayes matting, and its results are sometimes similar (fig. 2d), sometimes of less quality according to [Chuang et al. 2001].

Graph Cut [Boykov and Jolly 2001; Greig et al. 1989] is a pow- erful optimisation technique that can be used in a setting similar to Bayes Matting, including trimaps and probabilistic colour mod- els, to achieve robust segmentation even in camouflage, when fore- ground and background colour distributions are not well separated. The system is explained in detail in section 2. Graph Cut techniques can also be used for image synthesis, like in [Kwatra et al. 2003] where a cut corresponds to the optimal smooth seam between two images, e.g. source and target image.

Level sets [Caselles et al. 1995] is a standard approach to image and texture segmentation. It is a method for front propagation by solving a corresponding partial differential equation, and is often used as an energy minimization tool. Its advantage is that almost any energy can be used. However, it computes only a local mini- mum which may depend on initialization. Therefore, in cases where the energy function can be minimized exactly via graph cuts, the latter method should be preferable. One such case was identified by [Boykov and Kolmogorov 2003] for computing geodesics and minimal surfaces in Riemannian space.

1.2 Proposed system: GrabCut
========================================

Ideally, a matting tool should be able to produce continuous alpha values over the entire inference region Ty of the trimap, without any hard constraint that alpha values may only be 0 or 1. In that way, problems involving smoke, hair, trees etc., could be dealt with appropriately in an automatic way. However, in our experience, techniques designed for solving that general matting problem [Ru- zon and Tomasi 2000; Chuang et al. 2001] are effective when there is sufficient separation of foreground and background color distri- butions but tend to fail in camouflage. Indeed it may even be that the general matting problem is not solvable in camouflage, in the sense that humans would find it hard to perceive the full matte. This mo- tivates our study of a somewhat less ambitious but more achievable form of the problem.

First we obtain a “hard” segmentation (sections 2 and 3) using iterative graph cut . This is followed by border matting (section 4) in which alpha values are computed in a narrow strip around the hard segmentation boundary. Finally, full transparency, other than at the border, is not dealt with by GrabCut. It could be achieved however using the matting brush of [Chuang et al. 2001] and, in our experience, this works well in areas that are sufficiently free of camouflage.

The novelty of our approach lies first in the handling of segmen- tation. We have made two enhancements to the graph cuts mech- anism: “iterative estimation” and “incomplete labelling” which to- gether allow a considerably reduced degree of user interaction for a given quality of result (fig. 2f). This allows GrabCut to put a light load on the user, whose interaction consists simply of dragging a rectangle around the desired object. In doing so, the user is indi- cating a region of background, and is free of any need to mark a foreground region. Secondly we have developed a new mechanism for alpha computation, used for border matting, whereby alpha val- ues are regularised to reduce visible artefacts.

Their paper [Boykov and Jolly 2001] addresses the segmentation of a monochrome image, given an initial trimap T. The image is an array Z = (Z1,...,Zn,--.,ZN) of grey values, indexed by the (sin- gle) index n. The segmentation of the image is expressed as an array of “opacity” values @ = (Q,...,Qy) at each pixel. Gener- ally 0 < @, < 1, but for hard segmentation a, € {0,1}, with 0 for background and | for foreground. The parameters @ describe image

An energy function E is defined so that its minimum should cor- respond to a good segmentation, in the sense that it is guided both by the observed foreground and background grey-level histograms and that the opacity is “coherent”, reflecting a tendency to solidity of objects. This is captured by a “Gibbs” energy of the form:

where [@] denotes the indicator function taking values 0,1 for a predicate @, C is the set of pairs of neighboring pixels, and where dis(-) is the Euclidean distance of neighbouring pixels. This energy encourages coherence in regions of similar grey-level. In practice, good results are obtained by defining pixels to be neighbours if they are adjacent either horizontally/vertically or diagonally (8-way con- nectivity). When the constant B = 0, the smoothness term is simply the well-known Ising prior, encouraging smoothness everywhere, to a degree determined by the constant y. It has been shown however [Boykov and Jolly 2001] that it is far more effective to set B > 0 as this relaxes the tendency to smoothness in regions of high contrast. The constant B is chosen [Boykov and Jolly 2001] to be:

Minimisation is done using a standard minimum cut algorithm [Boykov and Jolly 2001; Kolmogorov and Zabih 2002]. This al- gorithm forms the foundation for hard segmentation, and the next section outlines three developments which have led to the new hard segmentation algorithm within GrabCut. First, the monochrome image model is replaced for colour by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in place of histograms. Secondly, the one-shot minimum cut estimation algorithm is replaced by a more powerful, iterative procedure that alternates between estimation and parameter learn- ing. Thirdly, the demands on the interactive user are relaxed by allowing incomplete labelling — the user specifies only Tg for the trimap, and this can be done simply by placing a rectangle or a lasso around the object.

Figure 2: Comparison of some matting and segmentation tools. The top row shows the user interaction required to complete the segmenta- tion or matting process: white brush/lasso (foreground), red brush/lasso (background), yellow crosses (boundary). The bottom row illustrates the resulting segmentation. GrabCut appears to outperform the other approaches both in terms of the simplicity of user input and the quality of results. Original images on the top row are displayed with reduced intensity to facilitate overlay; see fig. 1. for original. Note that our implementation of Graph Cut [Boykov and Jolly 2001] uses colour mixture models instead of grey value histograms.

The image is now taken to consist of pixels zn in RGB colour space. As it is impractical to construct adequate colour space histograms, we follow a practice that is already used for soft segmentation [Ru- zon and Tomasi 2000; Chuang et al. 2001] and use GMMs. Each GMM, one for the background and one for the foreground, is taken to be a full-covariance Gaussian mixture with K components (typi- cally K = 5). In order to deal with the GMM tractably, in the opti- mization framework, an additional vector k=fk1;:::;kn;:::;kNg is introduced, with kn 2 f1;:::Kg, assigning, to each pixel, a unique GMM component, one component either from the background or the foreground model, according as an = 0 or 11.

The new energy minimization scheme in GrabCut works iteratively, in place of the previous one-shot algorithm [Boykov and Jolly 2001]. This has the advantage of allowing automatic refinement of the opacities @, as newly labelled pixels from the Ty region of the initial trimap are used to refine the colour GMM parameters @. The main elements of the GrabCut system are given in fig. 3. Step 1 is straightforward, done by simple enumeration of the ky values for each pixel n. Step 2 is implemented as a set of Gaussian parameter estimation procedures, as follows. For a given GMM component k in, say, the foreground model, the subset of pixels F(k) = {Zn : kn =k and G@, = 1} is defined. The mean f1(a,k) and covariance £(@,k) are estimated in standard fashion as the sam- ple mean and covariance of pixel values in F(k) and weights are m(a,k) = |F(k)|/ Lx |F(k)|, where |S| denotes the size of a set S. Finally step 3 is a global optimization, using minimum cut, exactly as [Boykov and Jolly 2001].

The structure of the algorithm guarantees proper convergence properties. This is because each of steps 1 to 3 of iterative min- imisation can be shown to be a minimisation of the total energy E with respect to the three sets of variables k, 8, @ in turn. Hence E decreases monotonically, and this is illustrated in practice in fig. 4. Thus the algorithm is guaranteed to converge at least to a local minimum of E. It is straightforward to detect when E ceases to decrease significantly, and to terminate iteration automatically.

Practical benefits of iterative minimisation. Figs. 2e and 2f il- lustrate how the additional power of iterative minimisation in Grab- Cut can reduce considerably the amount of user interaction needed to complete a segmentation task, relative to the one-shot graph cut [Boykov and Jolly 2001] approach. This is apparent in two ways. First the degree of user editing required, after initialisation and opti- misation, is reduced. Second, the initial interaction can be simpler, for example by allowing incomplete labelling by the user, as de- scribed below.

Incomplete trimaps. The iterative minimisation algorithm al- lows increased versatility of user interaction. In particular, incom- plete labelling becomes feasible where, in place of the full trimap T, the user needs only specify, say, the background region Tp, leav- ing Tr = 0. No hard foreground labelling is done at all. Iterative minimisation (fig. 3) deals with this incompleteness by allowing provisional labels on some pixels (in the foreground) which can subsequently be retracted; only the background labels Tg are taken to be firm — guaranteed not to be retracted later. (Of course a com- plementary scheme, with firm labels for the foreground only, is also a possibility.) In our implementation, the initial Tz is determined by the user as a strip of pixels around the outside of the marked rect- angle (marked in red in fig. 2f).

Further user editing. The initial, incomplete user-labelling is of- ten sufficient to allow the entire segmentation to be completed au- tomatically, but by no means always. If not, further user editing is needed [Boykov and Jolly 2001], as shown in fig.5. It takes the form of brushing pixels, constraining them either to be firm fore- ground or firm background; then the minimisation step 3. in fig. 3 is applied. Note that it is sufficient to brush, roughly, just part of a wrongly labeled area. In addition, the optional “refine” operation of fig. 3 updates the colour models, following user edits. This prop- agates the effect of edit operations which is frequently beneficial. Note that for efficiency the optimal flow, computed by Graph Cut, can be re-used during user edits.

Given that a matting tool should be able to produce continuous al- pha values, we now describe a mechanism by which hard segmenta- tion, as described above, can be augmented by “border matting”, in which full transparency is allowed in a narrow strip around the hard segmentation boundary. This is sufficient to deal with the problem of matting in the presence of blur and mixed pixels along smooth object boundaries. The technical issues are: Estimating an alpha- map for the strip without generating artefacts, and recovering the foreground colour, free of colour bleeding from the background.

Border matting begins with a closed contour C, obtained by fitting a polyline to the segmentation boundary from the iterative hard seg- mentation of the previous section. A new trimap {7p,7y,7F} is computed, in which Ty is the set of pixels in a ribbon of width tw pixels either side of C (we use w = 6). The goal is to compute the map Q, n € Ty, and in order to do this robustly, a strong model is assumed for the shape of the @-profile within Ty. The form of the model is based on [Mortensen and Barrett 1999] but with two important additions: regularisation to enhance the quality of the es- timated o-map; and a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for estimating @ throughout Ty.

whose role is to encourage o-values to vary smoothly as ¢ increases, along the curve C (and we take A; = 50 and Ay = 103). For the DP computation, values of A; are discretised into 30 levels and 6; into 10 levels. A general smoothness term V would require a quadratic time in the number of profiles to move from ¢ to tf + 1, however our regularizer allows a linear time algorithm using distance transforms [Rucklidge 1996]. If the contour C is closed, minimization cannot be done exactly using single-pass DP and we approximate by using two complete passes of DP, assuming that the first pass gives the optimal profile for t = T /2.

The aim here is to estimate foreground pixel colours without colours bleeding in from the background of the source image. Such bleeding can occur with Bayes matting because of the probabilis- tic algorithm used which aims to strip the background component from mixed pixels but cannot do so precisely. The residue of the stripping process can show up as colour bleeding. Here we avoid this by stealing pixels from the foreground TF itself. First the Bayes matte algorithm [Chuang et al. 2001, eq. (9)] is applied to obtain an

Finally, the combined results of border matting, using both regularised alpha computation and foreground pixel stealing, are illustrated in fig. 7.

5 Results and Conclusions
========================================

Various results are shown in figs. 1, 8. The images in fig. 1 each show cases in which the bounding rectangle alone is a sufficient user interaction to enable foreground extraction to be completed automatically by GrabCut. Fig. 8 shows examples which are in- creasingly more difficult. Failures, in terms of significant amount of user interactions, can occur in three cases: (i) regions of low contrast at the transition from foreground to background (e.g. black part of the butterfly’s wing fig. 8); (ii) camouflage, in which the true foreground and background distributions overlap partially in colour space (e.g. soldier’s helmet fig. 5); (iii) background material inside the user rectangle happens not to be adequately represented in the background region (e.g. swimmer fig. 8). User interactions for the third case can be reduced by replacing the rectangle with a lasso”. The fox image (fig. 8) demonstrates that our border matting method can cope with moderately difficult alpha mattes. For difficult alpha mattes, like the dog image (fig. 8), the matting brush is needed.

The operating time is acceptable for an interactive user interface, e.g. a target rectangle of size 450x300 pixels (butterfly fig. 8) re- quires 0.9sec for initial segmentation and 0.12sec after each brush stroke on a 2.5 GHz CPU with 512 MB RAM.

Comparison of Graph Cut [Boykov et. al. 2001] and GrabCut. In a first experiment the amount of user interaction for 20 segmen- tation tasks were evaluated. In 15 moderately difficult examples (e.g. flowers fig. 1) GrabCutneeded significantly fewer interac- tions. Otherwise both methods performed comparably?.

Ina second experiment we compare GrabCut using a single “out- side” lasso (e.g. red line in fig. 2c (top)) with Graph Cut using two lassos, outer and inner (e.g. red and white lines in fig. 2c (top)). Even with missing foreground training data, GrabCut performs at almost the same level of accuracy as Graph Cut. Based on a ground truth database of 50 images’, the error rates are 1.36 +0.18% for Graph Cut compared with 2.13 + 0.19% for GrabCut .

In conclusion, a new algorithm for foreground extraction has been proposed and demonstrated, which obtains foreground alpha mattes of good quality for moderately difficult images with a rather modest degree of user effort. The system combines hard segmenta- tion by iterative graph-cut optimisation with border matting to deal with blur and mixed pixels on object boundaries.

In the previous lab session, OpenCV was the main library we used to implement most image processing algorithms. However, OpenCV does not provide efficient methods for the development of deep neural networks. There are many deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Caffe and TensorFlow) integrated with forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent, which enable us to materialise neural networks’ training and inference in a short time.

PyTorch is famous for its simplicity and ease of use, which is widely used by researchers in both academia and industry. Therefore, in this lab session, we will learn to develop deep neural networks with PyTorch. Before you start, you need to install PyTorch in your environment. You can follow the instructions at PyTorch’s official website: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/. You may select different installation commands of PyTorch as per your devices and requirements (Figure 1).

A PyTorch of only CPU is enough for this lab session since we will not implement a large model and training the model of this lab session with CPU only takes a few minutes. If your device is equipped with a NVIDIA GPU which supports CUDA and cuDNN, you can install a CUDA version which will significantly increase the training and inference speed of the neural network through hardware acceleration. In terms of installing PyTorch with CUDA support, Anaconda is highly suggested (especially if you are using Windows) because Anaconda automatically installs PyTorch’s dependencies of CUDA and cuDNN.

On top of that, we will use Torchvision which provides an abundance of APIs for image processing related to deep learning and OpenCV and NumPy for some image processing steps.

In this lab session, we use MNIST [1] dataset to train and test our model, a famous benchmark for handwritten numeral recognition. It contains 60000 images for training and 10000 images for testing, where every image is 28 by 28 pixels. This dataset is available on Moodle. Download the dataset and observe how it is organised. As for this dataset, it follows the structure below:

We can see that the dataset is divided into two folders: one is for training and the other is for testing. In each folder, there are 10 sub-folders containing images. For the images in a sub- folder, the name of the sub-folder represents its category, i.e., the training set for images of “0” is under the sub-folder name “MNIST/mnist_train/0/”. After observing the dataset structure, we can start to write the code for data preparation.

torch.utils.data.Dataset is required to customise our data preprocessing. We need to write a class that inherits from it to define how the data is loaded from the disk and how the images and labels are matched. torchvision.transforms.functional provides a series of APIs of image processing and data type conversion from NumPy/OpenCV to PyTorch tensor (similar to that of ndarray in NumPy), and vice versa. Remember, the input and output of the neural network should always be a PyTorch tensor, and they should be converted to another format (e.g., NumPy array) if further pre-processing and post-processing are required.

In self.__init__(), we need to load the paths of all the images (you can also load every image instead if your device has enough RAM, but it is not recommended because we can do it in self.__getitem__()), and match each image with its ground truth label). First of all, let’s add a parameter to self.__init__() to indicate which part of the dataset. It has two values: “train” or “test” depending on if we want to load the training set or test set, respectively.

Then let’s rewrite the self.__getitem__() method. This method is called when a mini-batch of training/testing data is going to be generated. In this method, we should retrieve an image path - label pair, and load and pre-process the image and label. self.__getitem__() has a parameter index which indicates the index of the image path - label pair among all image path - label pairs. First, let’s retrieve an image path - label pair according to the index.

What we need to consider is only the structure of the model and its forward propagation.

This is done by using nn.Linear where in_features and out_features represent the number of dimensions of the input and output feature vectors respectively. Since there are 10 categories in MNIST (from 0 to 9), the out_features of the classification head is set to 10.

Now let’s rewrite the self.forward() function. It receives one parameter x as the input which is a 4D tensor (mini-batch size, channel, height, width), where mini-batch size is the number of images in the mini-batch, channel is the number of channels in each image and height and weight represents the height and width of the image. Since we pre-processed the MNIST images to grayscale earlier, channel will be set to 1. Both height and width will be set to 28 since each image of MNIST is 28 by 28 pixels.

Next, we shall define the execution sequence of the two predefined convolutional layers. Each CNN layer is a combination of a convolutional layer and an activation function layer. A max-pooling layer is created after each CNN layer to reduce the size of feature map outputs by the CNN layer.

As for classification tasks, cross-entropy loss is widely used to measure the difference between the prediction of the model and the ground truth. PyTorch has provided us with an API of cross-entropy loss, i.e. torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss. However, in your further research, you may witness many kinds of loss functions which are not built-in by PyTorch. Therefore, you may be interested to know how to customise your own loss function. In this section, we will implement cross-entropy loss with basic PyTorch operations to show you how to

Similar to what we have done in the last section, we can customise a loss function by creating a class inheriting from torch.nn.Module so that the calculation of gradients of parameters can be calculated automatically with PyTorch instead of materialising it by ourselves. We need to define the procedure of the calculation of the loss function by rewriting the self.forward() method.

As for our customised cross-entropy loss, it receives three parameters: predictions, labels and reduction. predictions is the predicted confidence scores output by the model and is of the size (mini-batch size, 10). labels is a list of the size (mini-batch size) where each element is the ground truth category of each sample. reduction has two optional values: “mean” which refers to averaging the loss of each image in the mini-batch and “sum” which calculates the summation of it.

In this section, we will integrate all the above three components to conduct the training of the model. First, let’s create a Python file called train.py and import the three modules developed by us earlier:

Then we need to set some hyperparameters where BATCH_SIZE is the number of images in a mini-batch for each iteration, EPOCH is the number of epochs (1 epoch means the entire training dataset is passed through once) and LR is the learning rate.

Now let’s initialise the training set. Specifically, we need an iterator which returns images and labels of a mini-batch per iteration/loop. We can easily achieve this goal with torch.utils.data. First, let’s create an instance of the training set.
========================================
Source: ./documents/Laboratory Sheet 9 - CNN.pdf

Content:
mnist = MNIST(partition="train")
========================================
Source: ./documents/Laboratory Sheet 9 - CNN.pdf
File Type: pdf

Then we use torch.utils.data to get an iterator. Set the parameters of torch.utils.data.DataLoader where dataset receives the instance of our training set, batch_size is the size of the mini-batch returned per iteration, and shuffle indicates whether to shuffle the datasets. Setting pin_memory as True can reduce the time taken for each iteration. When the number of samples not yet visited during an epoch is less than the mini- batch size, they will be dropped if drop_last is True. The time taken to load the training set can be reduced by using multi-threads, where num_workers is the number of threads.

Now, it’s time to initialise the loss function. Here you have two options: using cross-entropy loss provided by PyTorch or using our customised cross-entropy loss:

The last step before training is to initialise an optimizer to conduct backpropagation and gradient descent. PyTorch has provided many different kinds of optimizers, such as SGD[2], RMSprop[3], and Adam[4]. In this lab session, we will use Adam as our optimizer.

Finally, we can launch the training. A for loop is used to go through all epochs, and for each epoch, another for loop is used to get a mini-batch of images and labels per iteration.

We want smooth regions in the image  • We still want the pixels in each   region to be similar, and those in   adjacent regions to be different  • One way to do this is to work with   regions rather than pixels  Region Growing  Start with a small ‘seed’ and   expand by adding similar pixels  Split & Merge  - Splitting divides regions that   are inconsistent  - Merging combines adjacent

1. Sort the pixels: low to high  2. For each pixels  -  -  -  This is a very basic version  If it’s neighbours are all unlabelled, give it a new label  If it has neighbours with a single label, it gets that label  If it has neighbours with two or more labels, it is a   watershed  -  It has certain problems in that it can give ‘thick’   watersheds rather than fine lines  -  It is sensitive to noise and so can generate lots of   small regions  -  It does show the basic plan, though

Watershed based segmentations can be very efficient - It is possible to implement it in O(n) time, where n is the number of pixels - Since it takes O(n) time to read or write an image, this is as good as it can get in most situations To implement watersheds we need to sort the pixels - They need to be sorted from highest to lowest gradient - Sorting is O(n log(n)), so how do we get an O(n) algorithm?

Abstract. Superpixels are becoming increasingly popular for use in computer vision applications. However, there are few algorithms that output a desired number of regular, compact superpixels with a low com- putational overhead. We introduce a novel algorithm that clusters pixels in the combined ﬁve-dimensional color and image plane space to eﬃ- ciently generate compact, nearly uniform superpixels. The simplicity of our approach makes it extremely easy to use – a lone parameter speciﬁes the number of superpixels – and the eﬃciency of the algorithm makes it very practical. Experiments show that our approach produces superpix- els at a lower computational cost while achieving a segmentation quality equal to or greater than four state-of-the-art methods, as measured by boundary recall and under-segmentation error. We also demonstrate the beneﬁts of our superpixel approach in contrast to existing methods for two tasks in which superpixels have already been shown to increase per- formance over pixel-based methods.

Superpixels provide a convenient primitive from which to compute local im- age features. They capture redundancy in the image [1] and greatly reduce the complexity of subsequent image processing tasks. They have proved increasingly useful for applications such as depth estimation [2], image segmentation [3,4], skeletonization [5], body model estimation [6], and object localization [7].

For superpixels to be useful they must be fast, easy to use, and produce high quality segmentations. Unfortunately, most state-of-the-art superpixel methods do not meet all these requirements. As we will demonstrate, they often suﬀer from a high computational cost, poor quality segmentation, inconsistent size and shape, or contain multiple diﬃcult-to-tune parameters.

For many vision tasks, compact and highly uniform superpixels that respect image boundaries, such as those generated by SLIC in Fig. 1, are desirable. For instance, graph-based models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF) can see dramatic speed increases when switching from pixel-based graphs to superpix- els [3,7], but loose or irregular superpixels can degrade the performance. Local features such as SIFT extracted from the image at superpixel locations become less meaningful and discriminative if the superpixels are loose or irregular, and learning statistics over cliques of two or more superpixels can be unreliable. This eﬀect can be seen when we compare the performance of SLIC superpixels to competing methods for two vision tasks: object class recognition and medical image segmentation. In both cases, our approach results in similar or greater performance at a lower computational cost in comparison to existing methods.

In this section, we brieﬂy review existing image segmentation algorithms and focus on their suitability for producing superpixels. Not all them were designed for this speciﬁc purpose and may lack the ability to control the size, number, and compactness of the segments, but we include them in our discussion nonetheless. We broadly classify superpixel algorithms into graph-based and gradient-ascent- based. Our survey, summarized in Table 1, considers the quality of segmentation, and the ability of these algorithm to control the size and number of superpixels.

In the case of QS09, d is a small constant (refer to [10] for details). The number of parameters listed in the table is the minimum required for typical usage.

The Normalized cuts algorithm [9], recursively partitions a given graph using contour and texture cues, thereby globally minimizing a cost function deﬁned on the edges at the partition boundaries. It is the basis of the superpixel segmenta- tion scheme of [1] and [6] (NC05). NC05 has a complexity of O(N 3 2) [12], where N is the number of pixels. There have been attempts to speed up the algorithm [13], but it remains computationally expensive for large images. The superpixels from NC05 have been used in body model estimation [6] and skeletonization [5].

Fezenszwalb and Huttenlocher [8] (GS04) present another graph-based seg- mentation scheme that has been used to generate superpixels. This algorithm performs an agglomerative clustering of pixel nodes on a graph, such that each segment, or superpixel, is the shortest spanning tree of the constituent pixels. GS04 has been used for depth estimation [2]. It is O(NlogN) complex and is quite fast in practice as compared to NC05. However, unlike NC05, it does not oﬀer an explicit control on the number of superpixels or their compactness.

While SL08 allows control of the size, number, and compactness of the superpixels, the quality and speed of the output strongly depend on pre-computed boundary maps.

Mean-shift [15] (MS02) is a mode-seeking algorithm that generates image segments by recursively moving to the kernel smoothed centroid for every data point in the pixel feature space, eﬀectively performing a gradient ascent [10].

Quick-shift [10] (QS08) is also a mode-seeking segmentation scheme like Mean-shift, but is faster in practice. It moves each point in the feature space to the nearest neighbor that increases the Parzen density estimate. The algorithm is non-iterative and, like Mean-shift, does not allow one to explicitly control the size or number of superpixels. Superpixels from quick-shift have been used in applications like object localization [7] and motion segmentation [16].

We include two other segmentation methods in the category of gradient as- cent algorithms: Watersheds [17] (WS91) and Turbopixels [12] (TP09). General watershed algorithms perform gradient ascent from local minima in the image plane in order to obtain watersheds, i.e. lines that separate catchment basins. Vincent and Soille [17] propose a fast version based on queuing of pixels. Lazy Snapping [3] applies graph cuts to the graph built on the superpixels output by this algorithm.

TP09 generates superpixels by progressively dilating a given number of seeds in the image plane, using computationally eﬃcient level-set based geometric ﬂow. The geometric ﬂow relies on local image gradients, and aims to distribute superpixels evenly on image plane. Unlike WS91, superpixels from TP09 are con- strained to have uniform size, compactness, and adherence to object boundaries.

Our approach generates superpixels by clustering pixels based on their color similarity and proximity in the image plane. This is done in the ﬁve-dimensional [labxy] space, where [lab] is the pixel color vector in CIELAB color space, which is widely considered as perceptually uniform for small color distances, and xy is the pixel position. While the maximum possible distance between two colors in the CIELAB space (assuming sRGB input images) is limited, the spatial distance in the xy plane depends on the image size. It is not possible to simply use the Euclidean distance in this 5D space without normalizing the spatial distances. In order to cluster pixels in this 5D space, we therefore introduce a new distance measure that considers superpixel size. Using it, we enforce color similarity as well as pixel proximity in this 5D space such that the expected cluster sizes and their spatial extent are approximately equal.

At the onset of our algorithm, we choose K superpixel cluster centers Ck = [lk,ak,bk,xk,yk]T with k = [1,K] at regular grid intervals S. Since the spatial extent of any superpixel is approximately S2 (the approximate area of a super- pixel), we can safely assume that pixels that are associated with this cluster center lie within a 2S × 2S area around the superpixel center on the xy plane. This becomes the search area for the pixels nearest to each cluster center.

Euclidean distances in CIELAB color space are perceptually meaningful for small distances (m in Eq. 1 ). If spatial pixel distances exceed this perceptual color distance limit, then they begin to outweigh pixel color similarities (resulting in superpixels that do not respect region boundaries, only proximity in the image plane). Therefore, instead of using a simple Euclidean norm in the 5D space, we use a distance measure Ds deﬁned as follows:

where Ds is the sum of the lab distance and the xy plane distance normalized by the grid interval S. A variable m is introduced in Ds allowing us to control the compactness of a superpixel. The greater the value of m, the more spatial proximity is emphasized and the more compact the cluster. This value can be in the range [1,20]. We choose m = 10 for all the results in this paper. This roughly matches the empirical maximum perceptually meaningful CIELAB distance and oﬀers a good balance between color similarity and spatial proximity.

At the end of this process, a few stray labels may remain, that is, a few pixels in the vicinity of a larger segment having the same label but not connected to it. While it is rare, this may arise despite the spatial proximity measure since our clustering does not explicitly enforce connectivity. Nevertheless, we enforce connectivity in the last step of our algorithm by relabeling disjoint segments with the labels of the largest neighboring cluster. This step is O(N) complex and takes less than 10% of the total time required for segmenting an image.

It is easy to notice that the idea of iteratively evolving local clusters and cluster centers used in our algorithm is a special case of k-means adapted to the task of generating superpixels. Interestingly, by virtue of using our distance measure of Eq. (1), we are able to localize our pixel search to an area (2S × 2S) on the image plane that is inversely proportional to the number of superpixels K. In practice, a pixel falls in the local neighborhood of no more than eight cluster centers. We also note that the convergence error of our algorithm drops sharply in a few iterations. Our experiments show that it suﬃces to run the algorithm for 4 to 10 iterations. We use 10 iterations for all the results in this paper.

The time complexity for the classical k-means algorithm is O(NKI) where N is the number of data points (pixels in the image), K is the number of clusters (or seeds), and I is the number of iterations required for convergence. Our method achieves O(N) complexity (see Fig. 4), since we need to compute distances from any point to no more than eight cluster centers and the number of iterations is constant. Thus, SLIC is speciﬁc to the problem of superpixel segmentation, and unlike k-means, avoids several redundant distance calculations.

ping [20], and by setting lower and upper bounds [21]. However except for [21], these methods do no achieve linear complexity for a given K. SLIC, on the other hand, is linear in the number of pixels irrespective of K. Note that, like [21], SLIC implicitly sets bounds on distance calculations, but does not need to com- pute or carry forward these bounds for the subsequent iterations. Unlike most of these segmentation schemes, which are very general in nature, SLIC is specif- ically tailored to perform superpixel clustering using the distance measure of Eq. (1) and is much simpler.

In this section we compare our superpixel segmentation method with four state- of-the-art algorithms, namely, GS041 [8], NC052 [6], TP093 [12], QS094 [7] using publicly available source codes. GS04 and NC05 are graph based methods while TP09 and QS09 are gradient based approaches. NC05 and TP09 are designed to output a desired number of superpixels while GS04 and QS09 require parameter tuning to obtain a desired number of superpixels. This choice of algorithms should provide a good representation of the state-of-the-art.

As mentioned in the introduction, it is important for superpixel algorithms to be easy to use. Diﬃcult-to-set parameters can result in lost time or poor perfor- mance. Table 1 summarizes the number of parameters that must be tuned or set for each method. SLIC, like NC05 and TP09 requires a single parameter. It is also important to note that GS04 and QS09 do not allow the user to control the number of superpixels. We had to perform a search on the parameter space to be able to control the number of superpixels in order to make a fair comparison to the other methods.

This is of interest because even low end consumer digital cameras produce images exceeding 3 million pixels. Also, GS04 requires 5×N memory to store edge weights and thresholds, as opposed to SLIC, which needs 1×N memory (to store the distance of each pixel from its nearest cluster center).

========================================
Source: ./documents/SLIC_Superpixels.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 10
Content:
A good superpixel segmentation algorithm should have low under-segmentation error as well as high boundary recall. To be useful as a pre-processing algorithm, such a segmentation should result in equally sized compact superpixels with control on its number. For the same reason, the algorithm should preferably also have low computational cost and require few input parameters. Fig. 3(b) shows that the highest boundary recall is achieved by GS04. This is because it produces several segments close to object boundaries as seen in Fig. 2(a). However, GS04 also exhibits higher under-segmentation error than our algorithm, as can be seen in Fig. 3(a). Our algorithm actually shows the lowest under-segmentation error in Fig. 3(a) as well as high boundary recall in Fig. 3(b) next only to GS04. Note that GS04, however, is not meant to output a desired number of superpixels of a given size unless a parameter search is performed, which requires several runs of the algorithm. Even then the superpixel sizes are unequal, making the algorithm far less suitable for superpixel-based applications [5–7]. In addition, as seen in Fig. 4(b) our algorithm is faster than the compared state-of-the-art algorithms for any image size (including GS04 for a single run) and it outputs the desired number of equally-sized compact superpixels.

Operating on superpixels instead of pixels can speed up existing pixel-based algorithms, and even improve results in some cases [7]. For instance, certain graph-based algorithms can see a 2 to 3-fold speed increase using superpixels [3]. Of course, the superpixel generation itself should be fast for this to be practical.

In each case, superpixels have been shown to increase the performance of an existing algorithm while reducing computational cost. We show that SLIC superpixels outperform state-of-the-art superpixel methods on these tasks, but with a lower computa- tional cost.

Our ﬁrst task is to perform object class recognition for 21 object classes from the STAIR vision library5 based on the work of Gould et al [22]. Color, texture, geometry, and location features are computed for each superpixel region. Then boosted classiﬁers are learned using these features for each region class. Finally, a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is learned using the output of the boosted classiﬁers as features. In the original work [22], NC05 is used to segment each image (of size 320 × 240 pixels) into about 200 superpixels. By applying SLIC superpixels instead of NC05, the classiﬁcation accuracy increases, as shown in Table 2, while the computational cost is reduced by a factor of 400.

Our second task is to assist recent eﬀorts towards a ’bottom up’ understanding of brain function by segmenting mitochondria from neural electron microscopy (EM) images. Neuroscientists attempting to reconstruct neural structures at an extremely ﬁne level of detail must typically perform a painstaking manual analysis on such data. Modern segmentation algorithms such as [7] can eﬃciently automate this process by taking advantage of superpixels. Below, we compare mitochondrial segmentations using an approach based on [7] for various types of superpixels including GS04, TP09, QS09, and SLIC. NC05 is omitted because its computational cost is impractical for such high resolution images.

Segmentations obtained for each superpixel method were compared over a set of 23 annotated EM images of 2048×1536 resolution, containing 1023 mitochondria. We used k = 5 k-folds cross validation for testing and train- ing. Results are given in Table 3, and example images appear in Fig. 5. The VOC score = TP TP+FP+FN is used to evaluate segmentation performance, as it is more informative than pixelwise accuracy for sparse objects such as mitochon- dria 6.

The advantages of the SLIC superpixel are demonstrated in the examples appearing in column 5 of Fig. 5. Features extracted over the regular, compact SLIC superpixels tend to be more discriminative, helping the graph-cut to pro- duce better segmentations. The good adherence to image boundaries exhibited by SLIC superpixels result in smoother and more accurate segmentations. We can also see the drawbacks of other superpixel methods by considering the ex- amples in columns 2 through 4 of Fig. 5. The irregularity of GS04 superpixels in column 2 makes the extracted features less discriminative, often causing the segmentation to fail. TP09, in column 3, performs the worst of the four methods. Because the intensity gradients in the EM images are not particularly strong,

Fig. 5. Segmentation results on EM imagery. Examples segmentations for GS04, TP09, QS09, and SLIC are cropped from 2048×1536 micrographs. Regular, compact superpix- els generated by SLIC exhibit good boundary adherence and produce the best segmen- tation results. The large superpixels produced by TS09 are a result of the algorithm merging small superpixels over relatively weak intensity gradients in the EM image, despite parameters being set for smaller superpixels. See text for further discussion.

TP09 tends to merge smaller superpixels, causing issues in the segmentation. In column 4, the superpixels of QS09 appear most similar to SLIC, but still re- sult in numerous segmentation failures where they do not respect mitochondrial boundaries as well as SLIC.

that are compact and roughly equally sized, for a low computational overhead. There are few superpixel algorithms that can oﬀer this and scale up for practical applications that deal with images greater than 0.5 million pixels. We present a novel O(N) complexity superpixel segmentation algorithm that is simple to implement and outputs better quality superpixels for a very low computational and memory cost. It needs only the number of desired superpixels as the input parameter. It scales up linearly in computational cost and memory usage. We prove the eﬃcacy of our superpixels in object category recognition and medical image segmentation, where compared to other state-of-the art algorithms, we obtain better quality and higher computational eﬃciency.

Computer vision is embracing a new research focus in which the aim is to develop visual skills for robots that allow them to interact with a dynamic, realistic environment. To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determin- ing the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.

This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, cfficicnt cuc for index- ing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique called Histogram Intersection, which matches model and im- age histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm called Histogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes.

In recent years a new set of ideas about the goals and the methods of computer vision has ‘gained promin- ence, and may be on its way to becoming the dominant paradigm, because it promises the quickest route to constructing working vision systems. The term used to describe this set of ideas is animate vision, introduced by Ballard (1989, 1991). Similar ideas have recently been expressed using the terms active perception (Bajesy 1985, 1988), active vision (Aloimonos et al. 1988; Aloimonos 1990), qualitative vision (Nelson 1989, 1991), inexact vision (Thompson 1986), and dynamic vision (Dickmanns 1988). As in many other areas of science and technology, one of the driving forces behind the change in research strategy has been the availability of new research tools. In this case it has been the advent of powerful real-time imaging-process- ing equipment, light-weight video cameras, and off-the- shelf computer-controlled-motors which allowed mov- able camera setups to be constructed.

with a known location, and determining the location of a known object. Color, because it is an identifying feature that is local, and largely independent of view and resolution, can be efficiently used for both tasks. The locality of color information leads to an efficient algorithm for recognizing three-dimensional objects from a variety of viewpoints. The color-identification algorithm can be used without figure-ground segmenta- tion, a task difficult to do without first recognizing the object. The algorithm can be used to identify defor- mable objects and substances described by mass nouns, something that most other recognition algorithms can- not be used for because they are based on shape.

The ease of recognition using color strands in contrast to the neglect given recently to color as a recognition cue, although it has been used in earlier work (Feld- man & Yakimovsky 1974; Garvey 1976; Ohlander et al. 1978). Instead, much more attention has been given to geometric algorithms that extract shape from stereo, motion, and lighting cues. The fundamental reason that

color has not been used may be that it is not intrin- sically related to the object’s class identity in the way that these other cues are. This view is well represented in Biederman (1985):!

Surface characteristics such as color and texture will typically have only secondary roles in primal access. . .we may know that a chair has a particular color and texture simultaneously with its volumetric description, but it is only the volumetric descrip- tion that provides efficient access to the representa- tion of CHAIR.

The implicit claim made in the quotation above is that form follows function: Geometrical cues will be the most reliable of object identity. While this may be generally true, it may not be true for routine behavior (Chapman 1990). In such behavior, wherein familiar objects are interacted with repeatedly, color may be a far more efficient indexing feature.

Color may be used in other situations as well. There are many examples in nature where color correlates with the class identity of an object, because of pigments which form part of the function of the object, or because species use it to send messages of enticement or warning. Similarly, color is used as a trademark or identifying feature in objects that occur in artificial environments, such as packaged goods, advertising signs, road signs, etc. Shape cues, in contrast to color, are highly resolution dependent, include only a highly restricted set that is view invariant (e.g., corners, zeros of curvature), and may require elaborate processing to extract them from an image.

Robotic vision systems can also use representations that are heavily personalized to achieve efficient behav- iors. For example, it may not be helpful to model cof- fee cups as being red and white, but yours may be, and that color combination is very useful in locating it and recognizing it. Recognition of a particular object is a task that is probably carried out as often as classifica- tion; and while classification may in some cases pre- cede recognition of the individual this need not be true in general.

Another reason why color has not been used may have been the lack of good algorithms for color con- stancy, thal is perceiving a stable perception of color over varying light conditions, as poeple do in most cir- cumstances. However, recently there has been great progress in correcting both for the chromaticity of the illuminant (Maloney & Wandell 1986; Forsyth 1990;

1.2 What vs. Where
========================================

File Type: pdf
Page Number: 2
Content:
Eye traces of human observers suggest that we do not build categorical databases of the world around us in- dependent of the task we are carrying out but that, in- stead, only highly selective regions of the scene are ex- amined in detail, and these are highly dependent on the task being carried out. Furthermore, the sequen- tial nature of the eye movement traces suggests that the visual architecture cannot analyze the entire picture at a glance but must break the analysis up into smaller sequential components. One gross distinction that we make is between identification algorithms that analyze the foveated area during fixation and location algo- rithms that direct the eyes to new targets.
========================================

Support for this what/where distinction comes from studies of human and primate brains. A significant feature of the gross organization of the primate visual brain is the specialization of the temporal and parietel lobes of visual cortex (Mishkin & Appenzcller 1987; Maunsell & Newsome 1987). The parietal cortex seems to be subserving the management of locations in space whereas the temporal cortex seems to be surbserving the identification of objects in the case where location is not the issue. In a striking experiment by Miskin (Miskin & Appenzeller 1987), monkeys with parictel lesions fail at a task that requires using a relational cue, but have no trouble performing a very similar task that requires using a pattern cue. The reverse is true for tem- poral lesions. Why should the primate brain be special- ized in this way? If we think generally about the prob- lem of relating internal models to objects in the world, then one way to interpret this “What/Where” dichot- omy is as a suggestion that image interpretation, the general problem of associating many models to many parts of the image simultaneously, is either too hard or unnecessary, or both (see table 1). In order to build vision systems that function in real time, perhaps the problem must be simplified. In sections 3 and 4, ap- proaches to the identification and location problems are

Section 2 introduces the multidimensional color histo- gram. Given a discrete color space, a color histogram counts how much of each color occurs in the image. Color histograms are invariant to translation, rotation about an axis perpendicular to the image, and change only slowly with rotation about other axes, occlusion, and change of distance to the object. On the other hand, histograms for different objects can differ markedly, and there are a huge number of possible histograms (ex- ponential in the number of different colors in the color space). Therefore, the color histogram is an excellent representation to use for identifying objects.

Section 3 introduces a method of comparing image and model histograms called Histogram Intersection, which is especially suited to comparing histograms for recognition because it does not require the accurate sep- aration of the object from its background or occluding objects in the foreground. Experiments show that Histo- gram Intersection can distinguish models from a large database, that it is robust to occlusion as well as image and histogram resolutuion, and that only a small number of histograms are needed to represent a three- dimensional object. They also show that an effective color-constancy algorithm will be needed for Histogram Intersection to work under variable light conditions. The section also describes a modification of Histogram Intersection called Incremental Intersection that allows efficient indexing into a very large database.

Section 4 shows how a model histogram can be used. to find the location of a known object (the target). The algorithm to solve this problem is called Histogram Backprojection. It finds the region in the image where the colors in the model histogram show up together, relying more on those colors that show up about as much as expected than those which show up much more, and therefore occur in other objects besides the target.

Given a discrete color space defined by some color axes (e.g., red, green, blue), the color histogram is obtained by discretizing the image colors and counting the num- ber of times each discrete color occurs in the image array. The image colors that are transformed to a com- mon discrete color are usefully thought of as being in the same 3D histogram bin centered at that color. To illustrate, figure 1 (see color figures on page 29) shows the output from a color camera together with a color histogram obtained from the image.

Histograms are invariant to translation and rotation about the viewing axis, and change only slowly under change of angle of view, change in scale, and occlusion (see color figures 2 and 3 on page 30). Because histo- grams change slowly with view, a three-dimensional object can be adequately represented by a small number of histograms, corresponding to a set of canonical views (Koenderink & van Doorn 1976; Feldman 1985).

Histograms define an equivalence function on the set of all possible colors, namely that two colors are the same if they fall into the same bin. This equivalence function is not ideal for recognition, because the relative range of colors that are considered the same as a given color depend on where the given color is located within the bin. Ideally, the colors considered the same would be in a region centered on the color, ur in some region whose shape depends on knowledge of the possible var- iations introduced by changes in lighting or noise in the sensors. It should be determined by the random ef- fect of how the color happens to link up with respect to the tesselation of the discrete color space. Another

problem is that the equivalence is all or nothing. Presumably, as the difference in color of two object patches increases the probability of them being the same object patch decreases smoothly. The binary threshold used to define the tesselation serves as a crude approx- imation to the probability function.

Histograms whose bins define overlapping bell- shaped (e.g. , Gaussian) functions of color space would address some of the concerns of the previous paragraph, as would interpolation coding (Ballard 1987). Exten- sions such as these have not been considered because histograms in their simplest form have worked well. Why do histograms works, despite their inherent prob- lems? Objects tend to have surfaces that are made up of regions of color. Because of shading and camera noise these regions are blurred in color space, and so span more than one bin in a historgram. When image and model histograms of the same object are matched, a high match value is obtained because the regions match well, even if point-by-point matches on the ob- ject’s surface are not always reliable.

This section describes how to use the color histogram to identify an object whose approximate location is known, the “Identification” problem of table 1. To iden- tify objects based on their color histogram, we must be able to judge the similarity of the color histogram of an image to the color histograms in the database. Section 3.1 introduces a method of comparing image and model histograms called Histogram Intersection, which tells how many of the pixels in the model histo- gram are found in the image. This method is especially suited to comparing histograms for recognition because

This is the desired behavior since complete segmenta- tion of the object from the background cannot be guar- anteed. Segmentation is still a topic of active reserach, but the indications from the large amount of research done in the past are that complete, efficient, and reliable semgnetation cannot be done prior to recognition.

There are a number of ways of determining the ap- proximate depth of an object, from laser or sonar range finders, disparity, focus, or touching the object with a sensor. The depth value combined with the known size of the object can be used to scale the model histogram. Alternatively, if it is possible to segment the object from the background and if it is not significantly occluded, the image histogram can be scaled to be the same size as the model histogram. Appendix A shows that when it is possible to segment the object from the background and thus scale the image histogram to be the same size as the model histogram, that Histogram Intersection is equivalent to the use of the sum of absolute differences or city-block metric.

Tf images are scaled by depth then Histogram Intersec- tion does not define a metric, since there is an asym- metry between the model and the image. That is, the model and image historgrams are not constrained to contain the same number of pixels, so the normaliza- tion factor in the denominator will differ matching image to model as matching model to image. This assymetry is a natural result of expecting background pixels in the image but not in the model.

For 6 = 0.4 (a reasonable number based on our ex- periments) and n = 512, the fraction is 1x10~>!. If histograms were distributed evenly throughout color space, the reciprocal of this number would approximate the carrying capacity of the histogram. But histograms are not distributed evenly throughout histogram space, as shown by figure 4 on page 30. For a back-of-the envelope calculation we can try to account for the unequal distribution by reducing the number of histo- gram bins to, say 100, as figure 2 would suggest. The fraction of histogram space is still very small, 3x107!'. A more accurate analysis might consist of generating a Monte-Carlo distribution of histograms throughout color space and measuring their overlap.

Here r, g, and b represent red, green, and blue signals, respectively. The rg, by, and wb axes are analogous to the opponent color axes used by the human visual system (Lennie & D’Zmura 1988). They were used here simply to allow the intensity (wb) axis to be more coarsely sampled than the other two, because the inten- sity axis is more sensitive to lighting variation from shadows and distance from the light source. The wb axis was divided into 8 sections, while the rg and by bins were cach divided into 16 sections, for a total of 2048 bins. Because the total intensity limits the color differences possible, only a fraction of them can actu- ally receive counts. For example, suppose the camera outputs a maximum M on each channel. Then if wb =O0(=g =b=0)orwh =3M(r=g=5b M) then the variables by and wb must both take on the value 0 (see (Swain 1990a) for more details).

Figure 9 shows how the Histogram Intersection match value changes as the camera is rotated about the Snoopy Doll shown in figure 5, and moved closer and further from the doll. Compare these match values to the ones in figure 10. Even at 45 degrees rotation or 1% times the original distance the match value (about 0.6) is higher than 99 percent of the false matches.

Another important claim is that recognition accuracy is fairly insensitive to image resolution. Table 2 shows how match success is affected by reducing the resolution of the images. The images were reduced in resolution by averaging the values of the pixels to be combined, and the histograms were taken from the reduced images. The model histograms were obtained from images of size 128 X90 and scaled by the appropriate multiplica- tive factor prior to matching. For each image the match values to each model are sorted; the rank is the posi- tion of the correct match in this list. The match percen- tile for each image matched is then calculated as (n- models — rank) / (n-model — 1), where n-models is the number of models in the database (66). The match percentile is averaged over all 32 images in the experi- ment. A value of 100 indicates perfect matching; a value of 99 indicates that, on average, the correct match scored a higher match value that 99 of 100 of the

histograms of more highly textured objects could change more dramatically over scale. Images obtained from typical cameras contain 512X485 (about '4 million) pixels, so these results suggest that color matching could be performed reliably on regions that cover as little as 1/1000 of the total image area, pro- vided the camera was focused well enough that camera blur did not destroy detail in the image.

Table 3 shows that match success is improved for extremely low-resolution images by obtaining the model histograms from low-resolution images as well. Since it is unlikely that matching will be done to such small parts of the image, scaling the model histogram will do in most circumstances. What this does suggest is that a hypothetical extremely inexpensive system that operated on very low-resolution images would be able to recog- nize the dominant object in the image using color about as well as a full-resolution system. Examples of the reduced-resolution images are shown in color figure 6.

These results demonstrate how match values will degrade under occlusion when the occluding object can be segmented from the object of interest. Matching in the presence of occlusion will be more difficult when segmentation cannot be achieved, because colors from the occluding object may also match to the models in- the database. Nevertheless, other experiments have shown that matching can be achieved even with some occlusion of this sort (see Swain (1990b)).

Figure 13 shows the effects of varying the size of the histogram over two orders of magnitude, from 64 accessible bins (8x 8X4 bins total) to 8125 accessible bins (40x40 x20 bins total). There are only small changes in the match effec- tiveness over the entire range of histogram sizes. Note that matches in the high resolution histograms rely on the fact that there are smooth distributions of colors on the objects. These distributions arise from the large regions of constant color being blurred in color by shading and camera noise. In the highest resolution histograms the same pixels are not matching each other, but different pixels from the same color region.

168 opponent color histograms, with good results, so the choice of color axes is not crucial either. The col- or camera was mounted in our mobile robot platform and panned across a floor containing the database of colored shirts. The shirts were spread out on the floor, but no special effort was made to lay them perfectly flat or approximate the view in the database. Since this experiment tests the ‘‘what” or identification problem, the panning is done so that the image serves as a fovea, that is, each shirt, when centered, occupies the major- ity of the image. Nevertheless, the shirts are close enough that there is often another shirt in the background when a match is being done. The shirt oc- cupying the major portion of the image is invariably the top notch.

As discussed at the beginning of this section, it is expected that a color-constancy algorithm be used before histogramming. Nonetheless, we tested Histo- gram Intersection in the presence of changing light in- tensity without color constancy. One aim is to see how necessary a color-constancy algorithm is. As we ex- pected, changes in lighting conditions affect the match value considerably. More importantly, this experiment can be also used to test how well a color-constancy algorithm must work. Changing light intensity was simulated by multiplying the image pixel values by a constant factor ranging from 0.4 to 1.6. The resulting pixel values were constrained to be no greater than 255, as would occur in a camera. The transformed images were matched to the original models. The results are displayed in figure 14.

It appears that with 16x16x8 opponent color histograms, where 8 is the number of bins along the white-black axis, good pruning of the possible matches can be achieved if the intensity is recovered to within about plus or minus 15 percent of the true values. Since one bin in the white-black direction only represents at most 12.5 percent of the maximum value in the histo- gram, the matching process can still work even if many of the counts fall in neighboring bins. This is because regions tend to cover a number of neighboring bins in color space, the same explanation for why fine-grain

These new axes provide only two degrees of freedom, since the values of any two define the third. With 8 x8 (r’, g') histograms, an average match percentile of 98.0 was achieved (see table 5), with the “worst ranking of an object matched to itself being a seventh place for the Raisin Bran box. The normalized intensity values are unaffected by changes in lighting intensity (assuming a linearized camera), making them much more effec- tive than the 3D histograms in variable lighting condi- tions. By placing an object of known reflectance in the image and normalizing the responses with respect to it, a third axis of color information could be recovered under variable intensity lighting.

lution. With three sensors, three-dimnensional histo- grams are sensitive to changing light conditions; and so, when the lighting is variable, it must be used after the pixel array has been transformed by an effective color-constancy algorithm. We demonstrated the effects of using the simplest color-constancy algorithm, scal- ing the color axes by the total intensity. The sensitivity to intensity variations was climinated, as the cost of a moderate decrease in the ability to prune objects from the database under changing lighting conditions.

Histogram Intersection is an efficient way of match- ing histograms. Its complexity is linear in the number of elements in the histograms. Two 16x16x8 histo- grams can be matched in 2 milliseconds on a SUN Sparcstation 1 (a 12 MIP RISC machine). The histo- grams themselves are efficient to compute using parallel image processing hardware. For instance, generating a 16x16x8 histogram from a 512X485 image takcs about 40 milliseconds using a Datacube FeatureMax board, including the time needed to transfer the histogram to the host.

Histogram intersection is efficient compared to most recognition schemes. Nevertheless, for large databases the linear dependence of the recognition scheme on database size will add up. Parallel processing is one way of attacking this problem, since the match over dif- ferent models is easily parallelizable. Another way, which reduces the recognition complexity to constant time for a broad range of databases, is described in the next section.

We introduce an algorithm, called Incremental Intersec- tion, for indexing into a large database efficiently on a sequential computer. In this scheme, only the largest bins from the image and model histograrus are com- pared, and a partial histogram intersection value is com- puted. The computation is incremental, so that the algo- rithm can be interrupted at any time after the sort with as good results as one could expect with the amount of time used. This last feature could prove to be im- portant in a system that interacts with a dynamic world, in which the times that actions are taken are often dic- tated by outside events.

The efficiency of Histogram Intersection and Incre- mental Intersection is compared in table 6. A complex- ity analysis shows that the time for Histogram Intersec- tion depends linearly on the product of the size of the histogram and the size of the database, ie., the algorithm is O(am), where nis the total number of bins in the histogram and m is the number of models in the database. The asymptotic complexity of Incremental In- tersection is O(n log n + cm), where c is the number of image bins used for indexing into the database. The complexity of Incremental Intersection is also linear in the size of the database. However, the constant factor is so low that for most databases the complexity is dominated by the sort of the image histogram bins.

Incremental Intersection only computes an approx- imation of the Histogram Intersection value, unless it is allowed to match every bin in the image histogram. One would think, therefore, that its performance would only be a fraction as good as complete Histogram Intersec- tion. Figure 15 shows that the match cffectivencss climbs very quickly and even surpasses that of Histo- gram Intersection using small numbers of image histo- gram bins. After examining 10 bins, Incremental Inter- section matches the images to the models without error, whereas in three cases the Histogram Intersection match value for the correct match was the second highest. How can this happen? Most of the surface of each object in the test database consists of at most five or six dif- ferent colors, so then histogram bins capture a good per-

The previous section discussed recognizing an unknown object whose location is known, the “Identification” box in table 1. This section discusses the complemen- tary task, locating a known object, the “Location” box in the same table. Determining the location of an ob- ject is necessary when execuling many tasks, not only looking for a “‘lost” object. Fixating a moving object, or a Stationary object when the robot is moving, also requires keeping track of the location of the object (Coombs 1989). Verging a pair of cameras upon an ob- ject requires determining the location of an object in both images so that they can be registered (Olson & Coombs 1991). All these tasks can be accomplished using color histograms and an algorithm called Histo- gram Backprojection.

While the effects of occlusion are different for Histo- gram Intersection and Histogram Backprojection be- cause the algorithms differ in how they process spatial information, the effects of changing image and histogram resolution are similar: Both algorithms will be success- ful if and only if the colors in the object stay in match- ing bins to the colors in the model. Since Histogram In- tersection is very insensitive to changing the image or histogram resolution it is expected that Histogram Backprojection will be as well. Likewise, Histogram Backprojection is expected to be about as sensitive to failures of color constancy as Histogram Intersection.

The advent of real-time image-processing hardware is changing the research focus of computer vision in a fundamental way. Instead of attempting to build elab- orate representations of the environment from static im- ages, a new objective is to construct visual skills which allow a robot to interact with a dynamic, realistic envi- ronment. To achieve this objective, new kinds of vi- sion algorithms need to be developed that are capable of running in real time and subserving the robot's goals. Two important skills for interacting with the environ- ment are identifying an object in a known location and locating a known object. We have shown here how ro- bust, extremely efficient algorithms for achieving these objectives can be designed using color histograms as their model and image representations. The robustness of the algorithms is directly related to their real-time performance. Since the algorithms function at or near video frame rates of 30 frames per second, they can fail on several frames per second and still achieve the overall goals of identification and location.

In the past research has concentrated on geometric cues. The shift toward real-time systems requires faster algorithms. For instance, in Rosenfeld’s comprehensive 1989 bibliography, there are thirty-seven articles on recognition of three-dimensional objects, all of which use shape? In contrast, there are no articles that use color for object identification. Color-based algorithms fulfill the requirement of such systems, because of their fast performance and capability of dealing with changes in view, object deformations, and inaccurate segmenta- tion of objects from their backgrounds.

Because of color’s important applications and ease of use, color cameras and digitizing facilitics should be a feature of robotic systems that have to operate in typical human surroundings. There are applications of computer vision being considered in which color could play an important role. For instance, manufacturers of automated check-out devices in grocery stores are con- sidering automating the identification of fruits and vegetables. Color would be an important identifying feature in this situation. As well, an aquarium is investi- gating installing equipment to automatically identify the fish swimming by a visitor to an aquarium. Again, the coloration of the fish could be an important identify- ing feature.

in such an environment using color would be straight- forward. Color may be the easiest way to label objects and locations for a robot. Robots could pick up the tools they need based on color, follow lines on the floor of various colors to go to specific destinations, dangerous objects could be color coded in certain ways, the boun- dary of the workspace could be denoted by a colored band.

One especially convenient aspect of manufacturing environments is that the lighting can often be carefully controlled. Consistent lighting would avoid the neces- sity of solving the color constancy problem. Lighting which can be described by a small set of basis func- tions is easier to discount than lighting which may be from a variety of sources with different spectra. Only one basis function is needed when the light is from only one type of bulb. Similarly, color constancy is easier to achieve if the surface reflectances come from a known distribution which can be described by a small number of basis functions. This objective may be more easily achieved in a constrained manufacturing environ- ment than in an unconstrained environment.

One problem that requires much more careful analysis is the appliction of color recognition under varying light conditions. In addition to the simple normalization scheme described in the text, Novak and Shafer’s the “guided” color-constancy algorithm of Novak and Shafer (1990) is a good one to try, because the large numbers of constraints introduced by the color chart they place in the scene should give it better color constancy than the algorithms that deduce the lighting from less reliable information. We conjecture that if the match- ing techniques introduced here don’t work under vari- able lighting using Novak and Shafer’s algorithm, they probably won’t work with any of the other algorithms.

The light source does not have to be beyond the con- trol of the robot or vision system. For instance, a robot could carry its own light source with it. If this light source were significantly stronger than the other lights in the room, only the intensity would change from image to image. If the distance to the object were known, even the intensity could be calculated. Some time of flight-range laser-range sensors also generate reflectance images. If a collection of lasers at different wavelengths were used, the reflectance images could be analyzed just as the color images are here.

A second challenging problem is identifying the region from which to extract the histogram for histo- gram intersection. Histogram intersection is fairly insensitive to pixels in the background, nonetheless, since they can cause mismatches and since cropping a portion of the object will diminish the match value, delimiting the object of interest is an interesting prob- lem. The answer to this problem will probably not be a single solution, but a number of different ones each of which works better under a different situation. For isolating a moving object, motion cues should be used; for isolating an object separated from its background by depth, disparity cues or cues from an active depth sensor should be used. The visual motion and dispar- ity cues or cues from an active depth sensor should be used. The visual motion and disparity cues may only be reliable at sparse points on the surfaces, and so they must be either extended by surface models or enclosed within a bounding region. A simple technique for eliminating background pixels based on verging on the object of interest and ignoring those pixels that do not register in the two eyes was demonstrated by Swain (1990a ). Other techniques such as desensitization to a commonly occuring background could be used.

The algorithms have not been tested in cooperation with a method for estimating the depth of the object. Provided the object is within a fairly small distance, let’s say 5 meters, the problem should be solvable us- ing standard techniques. In this range, vergence (stereo), laser-range finders, and focus can recover ap- proximate depth. A demonstration of this capability would be interesting. Estimating depth at long distances is more problematic, and may only be possible if other objects at a similar depth are first recognized and pro- vide scale.

It may be possible to use other surface properties besides color for identification and location, The most obvious one to try is texture. Instead of histogramming colors, outputs of nonoriented and oriented spatial fil- ters could be historgrammed. Malik and Perona (1990) have demonstrated a scheme for finding texture boun- daries based on the output of such filters, but they have not investigated how to recognize texture. There is one problem to be overcome in texture recognition that does not occur in color recognition, viz., that the diree- tionality of the filters does not make this scheme naturally orientation invariant. One approach to the solution of this problem would be to extract direction invariant measures from the output of the filters; another would be to attempt to align the image and

model before comparison of the histograms. One draw- back to the use of texture in machine vision systems is the large amount of computation needed. For in- stance, Malik and Perona employ the output of 192 dif ferent filters. Since Malik and Perona were proposing a biological model, cost of implementation in image processing hardware was not an issue. There may be ways of ecouvmizing on the use of filters using ap- proaches such as suggested by Freeman and Adelson (1990).

Is it possible that a histogram-style approach can work for shape recognition? Pigeons can recognize Charlie Brown pictures in a variety of positions, orien- tations, and scales (Hernstein 1982). They do not distinguish, however, between a correct Charlic Brown figure, and a “jumbled up” version where the figure has been cut in half, and the two halves rearranged. It is possible, therefore, that they are using some sort of histogram-like data structure for recognition which counts the local features that show up but does not con- sider their relative orientation.

The sum and minimum and division operations needed for Histogram Intersection and Histogram Back- production could easily be implemented in neural hard- ware. Could it be possible that algorithms similar to these are used in the brain? There are wavelength- sensitive cells in monkey Visual Area 4-that have large receptive fields and which could be loosely described as histogram cells. On the other hand, the work by Treisman (1985) and others on preattentive (“pop-out”’) phenomena suggests that people may have trouble searching for a conjunction of colors, as is done in the Histogram Backproduction algorithm. Until now, there has been no work in how color is used for identifica- tion or location in biological systems. This article pro- vides computational models whose presence could be explored in biological systems.

Each of the different bins of the histogram can be considered a different feature, as is done in pattern recognition (Young & Fu 1986). This approach to recognition has been studied extensively, and so it is important to discuss Histogram Intersection in relation to the approaches used in this disciplinc.

In pattern recognition, the set of features are designated to be axes in a feature space, in which the object is defined to be a point (fi, ..., f,). A metric is defined on the space, and identification is done by finding the nearest object in feature space to the set of features extracted from the image. Recall that metric space is defined as follows:

Something IMPORTANT to REMEMBER
========================================
Source: ./documents/Practicals - Histogram (Whole Image Understanding).pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 6
Content:
Histogram equalisation is achieved by computing the cumulative density function (CDF). The CDF provides a lookup table which specifies the mapping from input to output pixel values. To complete the mapping, the selected CDF value must be scaled back into the range of the image representation. For a 3-bit (8 value) image is done by dividing the CDF value by 1/(N-1) (where N is the number of Input Pixel Value rows) and rounding the result to a single integer value. Alternatively, you may also multiply the CDF value with (N-1) directly. The output histogram is obtained by considering each possible image value and working back through the mapping to see which bins in the input histogram map to that output bin. The output normalised frequency at a given bin is the sum of the input normalised frequencies of values that map to that bin.

Region Growing is a bottom-up approach. Starting from the seed point, the region is grown by adding neighbouring pixels if they satisfy a pre-defined criterion. In this case, the criterion is if the difference in pixel intensity is within the threshold selected. A Python implementation of a region growing algorithm is available on Moodle (regiongrow.py). Please inspect and understand it.

Split & Merge is a top-down approach. Starting from the input image, the algorithm first splits the image if the standard deviation of the region is above a certain threshold. To merge regions, the regions must fulfil two criteria: the regions are adjacent, and the regions fulfil the merge criteria. A Python implementation of the split & merge algorithm is available on Moodle (splitmerge.py). Please inspect and understand it.

A watershed is a thin line (at the top of a ridge) that arises from the boundary of a closed region. This is an edge-based segmentation approach. Python provides an implementation of the watershed algorithm through the function watershed, but some steps must be done first. OpenCV has provided a concise explanation of how to implement the watershed algorithm. Please read and understand the steps: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d3/db4/ tutorial_py_watershed.html.

1. Graph Cut
========================================
Source: ./documents/Laboratory Sheet 8 - Interactive Segmentation.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
Graph Cut is an interactive segmentation approach which segments out sub-regions of the user’s interest. The user can draw curves of different colours to indicate the foregrounds and backgrounds, and based on the given curves, Graph Cut will generate foreground masks. If the user is unsatisfied with the segmented result, the user can improve the results by drawing more curves.
========================================
Source: ./documents/Laboratory Sheet 8 - Interactive Segmentation.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
Note that Graph Cut is not available in OpenCV. As a result, an unofficial implementation will be used in this lab session. A Python implementation (GraphCut.py) and a test image (CMS_livingroom.png) are available on Moodle, or you may also use your own images. To use GraphCut.py, follow these steps:
========================================

2. Grab Cut
========================================
Source: ./documents/Laboratory Sheet 8 - Interactive Segmentation.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 2
Content:
As an improvement from Graph Cut, Grab Cut requires fewer interactions from the user. Specifically, the algorithm only requires the user to draw a rectangle around the foreground of interest to conduct the segmentation. Like Graph Cut, the user can improve the segmentation result by drawing curves to indicate the foreground and background of the image. Grab Cut can be performed using OpenCV’s built-in function grabCut:

Abstract—We propose a novel approach for solving the perceptual grouping problem in vision. Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images, as well as motion sequences, and found the results to be very encouraging.

importance of perceptual grouping and organization in vision and listed several key factors, such as similarity, proximity, and good continuation, which lead to visual grouping. However, even to this day, many of the computational issues of perceptual grouping have re- mained unresolved. In this paper, we present a general framework for this problem, focusing specifically on the case of image segmentation.

Since there are many possible partitions of the domain I of an image into subsets, how do we pick the “right” one? There are two aspects to be considered here. The first is that there may not be a single correct answer. A Bayesian view is appropriate—there are several possible interpretations in the context of prior world knowledge. The difficulty, of course, is in specifying the prior world knowledge. Some of it is low level, such as coherence of brightness, color, texture, or motion, but equally important is mid- or high- level knowledge about symmetries of objects or object models. The second aspect is that the partitioning is inherently hierarchical. Therefore, it is more appropriate to think of returning a tree structure corresponding to a hierarchical partition instead of a single “flat” partition.

level cues cannot and should not aim to produce a complete final “correct” segmentation. The objective should instead be to use the low-level coherence of brightness, color, texture, or motion attributes to sequentially come up with hierarchical partitions. Mid- and high-level knowledge can be used to either confirm these groups or select some for further attention. This attention could result in further repartition- ing or grouping. The key point is that image partitioning is

Prior literature on the related problems of clustering, grouping and image segmentation is huge. The clustering community [12] has offered us agglomerative and divisive algorithms; in image segmentation, we have region-based merge and split algorithms. The hierarchical divisive approach that we advocate produces a tree, the dendrogram. While most of these ideas go back to the 1970s (and earlier), the 1980s brought in the use of Markov Random Fields [10] and variational formulations [17], [2], [14]. The MRF and variational formulations also exposed two basic questions:

Our approach is most related to the graph theoretic formulation of grouping. The set of points in an arbitrary feature space are represented as a weighted undirected graph G = (V,E), where the nodes of the graph are the points in the feature space, and an edge is formed between every pair of nodes. The weight on each edge, w(i, j), is a function of the similarity between nodes i and j.

In grouping, we seek to partition the set of vertices into disjoint sets V1;V2;...;Vm, where by some measure the similarity among the vertices in a set Vi is high and, across different sets Vi, Vj is low.

for measuring the goodness of an image partition—the normalized cut. We introduce and justify this criterion in Section 2. The minimization of this criterion can be formulated as a generalized eigenvalue problem. The eigenvectors can be used to construct good partitions of the image and the process can be continued recursively as desired (Section 2.1). Section 3 gives a detailed explanation of the steps of our grouping algorithm. In Section 4, we show experimental results. The formulation and minimiza- tion of the normalized cut criterion draws on a body of results from the field of spectral graph theory (Section 5). Relationship to work in computer vision is discussed in Section 6 and comparison with related eigenvector based segmentation methods is represented in Section 6.1. We conclude in Section 7.

A graph G = (V,E) can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, A,B, AUB=V, AN B=, by simply removing edges connecting the two parts. The degree of dissimilarity between these two pieces can be computed as total weight of the edges that have been removed. In graph theoretic language, it is called the cut:

Wu and Leahy [25] proposed a clustering method based on this minimum cut criterion. In particular, they seek to partition a graph into k-subgraphs such that the maximum cut across the subgroups is minimized. This problem can be efficiently solved by recursively finding the minimum cuts that bisect the existing segments. As shown in Wu and Leahy’s work, this globally optimal criterion can be used to produce good segmentation on some of the images.

the minimum cut criteria favors cutting small sets of isolated nodes in the graph. This is not surprising since the cut defined in (1) increases with the number of edges going across the two partitioned parts. Fig. 1 illustrates one such case. Assuming the edge weights are inversely proportional to the distance between the two nodes, we see the cut that partitions out node n1 or n2 will have a very small value. In fact, any cut that partitions out individual nodes on the right half will have smaller cut value than the cut that partitions the nodes into the left and right halves.

where assoc(A,V) = Doicarev w(u, t) is the total connection from nodes in A to all nodes in the graph and assoc(B, V) is similarly defined. With this definition of the disassociation between the groups, the cut that partitions out small isolated points will no longer have small Ncut value, since the cut value will almost certainly be a large percentage of the total connection from that small set to all other nodes. In the case illustrated in Fig. 1, we see that the cut, value across node n will be 100 percent of the total connection from that node.

Furthermore, D-x(D —W)D> is symmetric positive semidefinite since (D — W), also called the Laplacian matrix, is known to be positive semidefinite [18]. Hence, zp is, in fact, the smallest eigenvector of (7) and all eigenvectors of (7) are perpendi- cular to each other. In particular, z;, the second smallest eigenvector, is perpendicular to zp. Translating this state- ment back into the general eigensystem (6), we have: 1) y =1 is the smallest eigenvector with eigenvalue of 0 and 2) 0 = 2) z = y!D1, where y, is the second smallest eigenvector of (6).

Thus, the second smallest eigenvector of the generalized eigensystem (6) is the real valued solution to our normal- ized cut problem. The only reason that it is not necessarily the solution to our original problem is that the second constraint on y that y(i) takes on two discrete values is not automatically satisfied. In fact, relaxing this constraint is what makes this optimization problem tractable in the first place. We will show in Section 3 how this real valued solution can be transformed into a discrete form.

========================================

eigenvector with the third smallest eigenvalue is the real valued solution that optimally subpartitions the first two parts. In fact, this line of argument can be extended to show that one can subdivide the existing graphs, each time using the eigenvector with the next smallest eigenvalue. How- ever, in practice, because the approximation error from the real valued solution to the discrete valued solution accumulates with every eigenvector taken and all eigen- vectors have to satisfy a global mutual orthogonality constraint, solutions based on higher eigenvectors become unreliable. It is best to restart solving the partitioning problem on each subgraph individually.

Fortunately, our graph partitioning has the follow- ing properties: 1) The graphs are often only locally connected and the resulting eigensystems are very sparse, 2) only the top few eigenvectors are needed for graph partitioning, and 3) the precision require- ment for the eigenvectors is low, often only the right sign bit is required. These special properties of our problem can be fully exploited by an eigensolver called the Lanczos method. The running time of a Lanczos algorithm is O(mn)+O(mM(n)) [11], where m is the maximum number of matrix-vector computations required and M(n) is the cost of a matrix-vector computation of Az, where A=D>(D- Ww)D>. Note that the sparsity struc- ture of A is identical to that of the weight matrix W. Since W is sparse, so is A and the matrix-vector computation is only O(n).

To see why this is the case, we will look at the cost of the inner product of one row of A with a vector x. Let y; = Aj-x = yj Aj;x;. For a fixed i, Ajj is only nonzero if node j is in a spatial neighborhood of i. Hence, there are only a fixed number of operations required for each A;-x and the total cost of computing Ax is O(n).

The constant factor is determined by the size of the spatial neighborhood of a node. It turns out that we can substantially cut down additional connec- tions from each node to its neighbors by randomly selecting the connections within the neighborhood for the weighted graph. Empirically, we have found that one can remove up to 90 percent of the total connections with each of the neighborhoods when the neighborhoods are large without affecting the eigenvector solution to the system.

Putting everything together, each of the matrix- vector computations cost O(n) operations with a small constant factor. The number m depends on many factors [11]. In our experiments on image segmentation, we observed that m is typically less than O(n?).

Once the eigenvectors are computed, we can parti- tion the graph into two pieces using the second smallest eigenvector. In the ideal case, the eigenvec- tor should only take on two discrete values and the signs of the values can tell us exactly how to partition the graph. However, our eigenvectors can take on continuous values and we need to choose a splitting point to partition it into two parts. There are many different ways of choosing such a splitting point. One can take 0 or the median value as the splitting point or one can search for the splitting point such that the resulting partition has the best Neut(A, B) value. We take the latter approach in our work. Currently, the search is done by checking / evenly spaced possible splitting points, and comput- ing the best Neut among them. In our experiments, the values in the eigenvectors are usually well separated and this method of choosing a splitting point is very reliable even with a small /.

4. After the graph is broken into two pieces, we can recursively run our algorithm on the two partitioned parts. Or, equivalently, we could take advantage of the special properties of the other top eigenvectors as explained in the previous section to subdivide the graph based on those eigenvectors. The recursion stops once the Ncut value exceeds certain limit.

We also impose a stability criterion on the

partition. As we saw earlier, and as we see in the eigenvectors with the seventh to ninth smallest eigenvalues (Fig. 3g-h), sometimes an eigenvector can take on the shape of a continuous function, rather that the discrete indicator function that we seek. From the view of segmentation, such an eigenvector is attempting to subdivide an image region where there is no sure way of breaking it. In fact, if we are forced to partition the image based on this eigenvector, we will see there are many different splitting points which have similar Ncut values. Hence, the partition will be highly uncertain and unstable. In our current segmentation scheme, we simply choose to ignore all those eigenvectors which have smoothly varying eigenvector values. We achieve this by imposing a stability criterion which measures the degree of smoothness in the eigenvec- tor values. The simplest measure is based on first computing the histogram of the eigenvector values and then computing the ratio between the minimum and maximum values in the bins. When the eigenvector values are continuously varying, the values in the histogram bins will stay relatively the same and the ratio will be relatively high. In our experiments, we find that simple thresholding on the ratio described above can be used to exclude unstable eigenvectors. We have set that value to be 0.06 in all our experiments.

Instead of finding the partition using recursive 2-way cut as described above, one can use all of the top eigenvectors to simultanously obtain a K-way partition. In this method, the n top eigenvectors are used as n dimensional indicator vectors for each pixel. In the first step, a simple clustering algorithm, such as the k-means algorithm, is used to obtain an oversegmentation of the image into k0 groups. No attempt is made to identify and exclude oscillatory eigenvectors—they exacerbate the oversegmentation, but that will be dealt with subsequently.

Global recursive cut. From the initial k’ segments, we can build a condensed graph G° = (V°, E°), where each segment A; corresponds to a node V¥ of the graph. The weight on each graph edge W'(i, j) is defined to be assoc(A;, Aj), the total edge weights from elements in A; to elements in Aj. From this condensed graph, we then recursively bipartition the graph according the Ncut criterion. This can be carried out either with the generalized eigenvalue system, as in Section 3.2, or with exhaustive search in the discrete domain. Exhaustive search is possible in this case since k’ is small, typically k’ < 100.

The computational approach that we have developed for image segmentation is based on concepts from spectral graph theory. The core idea is to use matrix theory and linear algebra to study properties of the incidence matrix, W, and the Laplacian matrix, D —W, of the graph and relate them back to various properties of the original graph. This is a rich area of mathematics and the idea of using eigenvectors of the Laplacian for finding partitions of graphs can be traced back to Cheeger [4], Donath and Hoffman [7], and Fiedler [9]. This area has also seen contributions by theoretical computer scientists [1], [3], [22], [23]. It can be shown that our notion of normalized cut is related by a constant factor to the concept of conductance in [22].

Earlier work on spectral partitioning used the second eigenvectors of the Laplacian of the graph defined as D — W to partition a graph. The second smallest eigenvalue of D — W is sometimes known as the Fiedler value. Several results have been derived relating the ratio cut and the (A.V - A), which, in fact, is the standard definition of the Cheeger Fiedler value. A ratio cut of a partition of V, P = constant, is defined as . It was shown that if the Fiedler value is small, partitioning the graph based on the Fiedler vector will lead to good ratio cut [1], [23]. O derivation in Section 2.1 can be adapted (by replacing the c ir matrix D in the denominators by the identity matrix I) to show that the Fiedler vector is a real valued solution to the problem of minacv ath + a, the average cut. which we can call

There is, however, one application area that has seen substantial application of spectral partitio- ning—the area of parallel scientific computing. The pro- blem there is to balance the workload over multiple processors taking into account communication needs. One of the early papers is [18]. The generalized eigenvalue approach was first applied to graph partitioning by [8] for dynamically balancing computational load in a parallel computer. Their algorithm is motivated by [13]’s paper on representing a hypergraph in a Euclidean space.

As one might expect, a physical analogy can be set up for the generalized eigenvalue system (6) that we used to approximate the solution of normalized cut. We can construct a spring-mass system from the weighted graph by taking graph nodes as physical nodes and graph edges as springs connecting each pair of nodes. Furthermore, we will define the graph edge weight as the spring stiffness and the total edge weights connecting to a node as its mass.

shake to this spring-mass system, forcing the nodes to oscillate in the direction perpendicular to the image plane. Nodes that have stronger spring connections among them will likely oscillate together. As the shaking becomes more violent, weaker springs connecting to this group of node will be overstretched. Eventually, the group will “pop” off from the image plane. The overall steady state behavior of the nodes can be described by its fundamental mode of oscillation. In fact, it can be shown that the fundamental modes of oscillation of this spring mass system are exactly the generalized eigenvectors of (6).

In the computer vision community, there has been some been previous work on image segmentation formulated as a graph partition problem. Wu and Leahy [25] use the minimum cut criterion for their segmentation. As mentioned earlier, our criticism of this criterion is that it tends to favor cutting off small regions, which is undesirable in the context of image segmentation. In an attempt to get more balanced partitions, Cox et al. [6] seek to minimize the ratio ae A CV, where weight(A) is some function of the set A. When weight(A) is taken to be the sum of the elements in A, we see that this criterion becomes one of the terms in the definition of average cut above. Cox et al. use an efficient discrete algorithm to solve their optimization problem assuming the graph is planar.

The normalized cut formulation has a certain resemblance to the average cut, the standard spectral graph partitioning, as well as average association formulation. All three of these algorithms can be reduced to solving certain eigenvalue systems. How are they related to each other?

the normalized association and the average association are trying to find “tight” clusters in the graph. Since the normalized association is exactly 2 — ncut, the normalized cut value, the normalized cut formulation seeks a balance between the goal of clustering and segmentation. It is, therefore, not too surprising to see that the normalized cut vector can be approximated with the generalized eigenvec- tor of (D — W)x = ADx, as well as that of Wx = ADx.

Judging from the discrete formulations of these three grouping criteria, it can be seen that the average association, oe has a bias for finding tight clusters. Therefore, it runs the risk of becoming too greedy in finding small, but tight, clusters in the data. This might be perfect for data that are Gaussian distributed. However, for typical data in the real world that are more likely to be made up of a mixture of various different types of distributions, this bias in grouping will have undesired consequences, as we shall illustrate in the examples below.

For average cut, we a the opposite problem arises—one cannot ensure the two partitions computed will have tight within-group similarity. This becomes particu- larly problematic if the dissimilarity among the different groups varies from one to another, or if there are several possible partitions all with similar average cut values.

has the slowest decreasing rate among the three. With this weighting function, most points have some nontrivial connections to the rest. To find a cut of the graph, a number of edges with heavy weights have to be removed. In addition, the cluster on the right has less within-group similarity comparing with the cluster on the left. In this case, average cut has trouble deciding on where to cut.

These problems, illustrated in Figs. 14, 15, and 16, in fact are quite typical in segmenting real natural images. This is particularly true in the case of texture segmentation. Different texture regions often have very different within- group similarity or coherence. It is very difficult predetermine the right weighting function on each image region. Therefore, it is important to design a grouping to algorithm that is more tolerant to a wide range of weighting functions. The advantage of using normalized cut becomes more evident in this case. Fig. 17 illustrates this point on a natural texture image shown previously in Fig. 10.

The 1D data is made up by two subsets of points, one randomly distributed from 0 to 0.5 and the other from 0.65 to 1.0. Each data point is taken as a node in the graph and the weighted graph edge connecting two points is defined to be inversely proportional to the distance between two nodes. We will use three monotonically decreasing weighting functions, w(x) = f(d(x)), defined on the distance function, d(x), with different rate of fall-off. The three weighting functions are plotted in Figs. 14a, 15a, and 16a.

In this paper, we developed a grouping algorithm based on the view that perceptual grouping should be a process that aims to extract global impressions of a scene and provides a hierarchical description of it. By treating the grouping problem as a graph partitioning problem, we proposed the normalized cut criteria for segmenting the graph. Normal- ized cut is an unbiased measure of disassociation between subgroups of a graph and it has the nice property that minimizing normalized cut leads directly to maximizing the

A computational method based on this idea has been developed and applied to segmentation of brightness, color, and texture images. Results of experiments on real and synthetic images are very encouraging and illustrate that the normalized cut criterion does indeed satisfy our initial goal of extracting the “big picture” of a scene.

This research was supported by (ARO) DAAH04-96-1-0341, and a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship to J. Shi. We thank Christos Papadimitriou for supplying the proof of NP-completeness for normalized cuts on a grid. In addition, we wish to acknowledge Umesh Vazirani and Alistair Sinclair for discussions on graph theoretic algo- rithms and Inderjit Dhillon and Mark Adams for useful pointers to numerical packages. Thomas Leung, Serge Belongie, Yeir Weiss, and other members of the computer vision group at UC Berkeley provided much useful feed- back on our algorithm.

How big should the filter window be ?  - With Gaussian filters this depends on the   variance (σ2)  - Under a Gaussian curve 98% of the area   lies within 2σ of the mean  - A filter width of 5σ gives more than 98% of   the values we want  98.8%

The separated filter is separable is more efficient  - Given an N x N image and a n x n filter we need to do O(N2n2) operations  - Applying two n x 1 filters to a N x N image takes O(2N2n) operations  Example  - A 600 x 400 image and a 5 x 5 filter  - Applying it directly takes around 6,000,000 operations  - Using a separable filter takes around 2,400,000 – less   than half as many

The need to separate one material from another, or identify a particular material, arises in many image processing applications. From industrial inspection, where you might be asked to identify pixels depicting correctly manufactured cloth, to human-computer interaction, where you might need to detect human skin, the core problem remains the same: develop a processing pipeline that converts a colour image into a binary image, labelling different materials.

Biological science is a current growth area for image processing and computer vision. Biologists now have access to powerful tools that allow them to study the genetic structure of plants and animals, but lack the accurate, quantitative data on plant and animal structure as well as behaviour needed to understand the effect different genetic factors have. Plant science is an area of particular activity, as improved plant species are urgently needed to provide food to an expanding population.

Thresholding/Segmentation: image regions corresponding to nuclei must be identified, and thresholding is a common approach. The method used varies and may be global or local. Methods that automatically determine the threshold value have obvious advantages over those that require user interaction.

Binary image processing: Identifying a perfect threshold value or segmentation method is almost impossible, and most methods will result in some mis-classified pixels. A further binary image processing stage is often needed to clean up the image, hopefully leaving it containing only regions that correspond to plants. Nothing, however, is perfect.

File Type: pdf
Page Number: 2
Content:
Dataset 1: Images of three species of flowers are randomly collected in a folder available from Moodle. The images are selected based on their complexity of their foreground/background features and categorise into three sub-folders (e.g., easy, medium and hard) within the input-image folder. These images will be used by you when developing your image processing pipeline. To aid with analysing the effectiveness of your image processing pipeline, ground truth for each image is provided within the ground-truth folder, again categorised within three sub-folders (e.g., easy, medium and hard). NOTE: you are not allowed to modify the ground truths. This dataset it to be used to fulfil the segmentation part (detailed below).

Dataset 2: This consists of 847 images with its corresponding ground truths. You are to use this dataset when fulfilling the semantic part (detailed below).

SEGMENTATION PART: Design and implement a single Python program that inputs one of the images from dataset 1 at a time and outputs an output image which has a black background with ONLY the segmented flower as shown in Figure 1. You may not need to employ all the steps listed above, but you will probably find it worthwhile to at least consider them all. You are also encouraged to use other strategies covered in this module to address the flower segmentation problem.

The focus of this coursework is on designing and developing your image processing pipeline to perform the above- mentioned tasks. You must make sure to evaluate the final outcome. The evaluation can be both qualitative and quantitative – for example mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) can be use as the metrics to evaluate your image processing pipeline’s performance. More metrics (that you can use) for image segmentation will be covered in lecture 7.

You are required to make your code easy to be executed by the marker. In other words, the marker can run your code and reproduce your given outputs. After the execution of your program, it is expected that each image in the input- image folder has a corresponding segmentation result represented by a .jpg file saved in the output folder, categorised within three sub-folders (e.g., easy, medium, and hard) with the same name as the image. As mentioned earlier, your output image must have a black background with only the segmented flower. Additionally, images generated as part of your image processing pipeline can be saved in the image-processing-pipeline folder whereby you can create sub- folders for each input image and label the sub-folders as the same name as the input image.

A Transformer base and Model_input Python file will be provided to you. NOTE: you are not allowed to modify any of the provided parameters in the transformer and Model_input. The classification results (e.g., cosine similarity & accuracy) will be a pixel-wise classification whereby your segmented images (from the SEGMENTATION PART) is compared to the ground truth masks. Your image processing pipeline is the fundamental component of this entire process whereby your pipeline acts as a way to improve the quality of the original dataset prior to being classified. Please refer to the guidelines for using the segmentation evaluation model PDF for further details of using the two provided files.

Sampling & quantisation are   often under user control   during image capture and   have a significant effect on   the image  Both can be changed to   some extent after capture,   but the resulting images are   often approximations  REMEMBER  Be aware of the Nyquist rule when choosing   an image resolution; it can introduce   artefacts that are difficult to remove

Sometimes we want a single value at each pixel • Makes processing easier • Reduces the amount of information • Makes some of the theory simpler Many image processing methods were developed for single value images This value is usually the intensity or grey level - We can compute the grey value using a Early CCDs only produced grey simple average of red, green and blue level; rare now - But our eyes are more sensitive to green light so…

Abstract
========================================

File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
We present a new, interactive tool called Intelligent Scissors which we use for image segmentation and composition. Fully auto- mated segmentation is an unsolved problem, while manual tracing is inaccurate and laboriously unacceptable. However, Intelligent Scissors allow objects within digital images to be extracted quickly and accurately using simple gesture motions with a mouse. When the gestured mouse position comes in proximity to an object edge, a live-wire boundary “snaps” to, and wraps around the object of interest.

Live-wire boundary detection formulates discrete dynamic pro- gramming (DP) as a two-dimensional graph searching problem. DP provides mathematically optimal boundaries while greatly reducing sensitivity to local noise or other intervening structures. Robust- ness is further enhanced with on-the-ﬂy training which causes the boundary to adhere to the speciﬁc type of edge currently being fol- lowed, rather than simply the strongest edge in the neighborhood. Boundary cooling automatically freezes unchanging segments and automates input of additional seed points. Cooling also allows the user to be much more free with the gesture path, thereby increasing the efﬁciency and ﬁnesse with which boundaries can be extracted.

Extracted objects can be scaled, rotated, and composited using live-wire masks and spatial frequency equivalencing. Frequency equivalencing is performed by applying a Butterworth ﬁlter which matches the lowest frequency spectra to all other image compo- nents. Intelligent Scissors allow creation of convincing composi- tions from existing images while dramatically increasing the speed and precision with which objects can be extracted.

Digital image composition has recently received much attention for special effects in movies and in a variety of desktop applica- tions. In movies, image composition, combined with other digital manipulation techniques, has also been used to realistically blend old ﬁlm into a new script. The goal of image composition is to com- bine objects or regions from various still photographs or movie frames to create a seamless, believable, image or image sequence which appears convincing and real. Fig. 9(d) shows a believable composition created by combining objects extracted from three images, Fig. 9(a-c). These objects were digitally extracted and combined in a few minutes using a new, interactive tool calledIntel- ligent Scissors.

When using existing images, objects of interest must be extracted and segmented from a surrounding background of unpredictable complexity. Manual segmentation is tedious and time consuming, lacking in precision, and impractical when applied to long image

This paper describes a new, interactive, digital image segmenta- tion tool called “Intelligent Scissors” which allows rapid object extraction from arbitrarily complex backgrounds. Intelligent Scis- sors boundary detection formulates discrete dynamic programming (DP) as a two-dimensional graph searching problem. Presented as part of this tool are boundary cooling and on-the-ﬂy training, which reduce user input and dynamically adapt the tool to speciﬁc types of edges. Finally, we present live-wire masking and spatial frequency equivalencing for convincing image compositions.

Digital image segmentation techniques are used to extract image components from their surrounding natural background. However, currently available computer based segmentation tools are typically primitive and often offer little more advantage than manual tracing.

Region based magic wands, provided in many desktop applica- tions, use an interactively selected seed point to “grow” a region by adding adjacent neighboring pixels. Since this type of region grow- ing does not provide interactive visual feedback, resulting region boundaries must usually be edited or modiﬁed.

Other popular boundary deﬁnition methods use active contours or snakes[1, 5, 8, 15] to improve a manually entered rough approx- imation. After being initialized with a rough boundary approxima- tion, snakes iteratively adjust the boundary points in parallel in an attempt to minimize an energy functional and achieve an optimal boundary. The energy functional is a combination of internal forces, such as boundary curvature, and external forces, like image gradient magnitude. Snakes can track frame-to-frame boundary motion provided the boundary hasn’t moved drastically. However, active contours follow a pattern of initialization followed by energy minimization; as a result, the user does not know what the ﬁnal boundary will look like when the rough approximation is input. If the resulting boundary is not satisfactory, the process must be repeated or the boundary must be manually edited. We provide a detailed comparison of snakes and Intelligent Scissors in section 3.6.

Another class of image segmentation techniques use a graph searching formulation of DP (or similar concepts) to ﬁnd globally optimal boundaries [2, 4, 10, 11, 14]. These techniques differ from snakes in that boundary points are generated in a stage-wise optimal cost fashion whereas snakes iteratively minimize an energy func- tional for all points on a contour in parallel (giving the appearance of wiggling). However, like snakes, these graph searching tech- niques typically require a boundary template--in the form of a man- ually entered rough approximation, a ﬁgure of merit, etc.--which is used to impose directional sampling and/or searching constraints. This limits these techniques to a boundary search with one degree of freedom within a window about the two-dimensional boundary template. Thus, boundary extraction using previous graph search- ing techniques is non-interactive (beyond template speciﬁcation), losing the beneﬁts of further human guidance and expertise.

The most important difference between previous boundary ﬁnd- ing techniques and Intelligent Scissors presented here lies not in the boundary deﬁning criteria per se´, but in the method of interaction. Namely, previous methods exhibit a pattern of boundary approxi- mation followed by boundary reﬁnement, whereas Intelligent Scis- sors allow the user to interactively select the most suitable boundary from a set of all optimal boundaries emanating from a seed point. In addition, previous approaches do not incorporate on- the-ﬂy training or cooling, and are not as computationally efﬁcient. Finally, it appears that the problem of automated matching of spa- tial frequencies for digital image composition has not been addressed previously.

Boundary deﬁnition via dynamic programming can be formu- lated as a graph searching problem [10] where the goal is to ﬁnd the optimal path between a start node and a set of goal nodes. As applied to image boundary ﬁnding, the graph search consists of ﬁnding the globally optimal path from a start pixel to a goal pixel-- in particular, pixels represent nodes and edges are created between each pixel and its 8 neighbors. For this paper, optimality is deﬁned as the minimum cumulative cost path from a start pixel to a goal pixel where the cumulative cost of a path is the sum of the local edge (or link) costs on the path.

Since a minimum cost path should correspond to an image com- ponent boundary, pixels (or more accurately, links between neigh- boring pixels) that exhibit strong edge features should have low local costs and vice-versa. Thus, local component costs are created from the various edge features:

The laplacian zero-crossing is a binary edge feature used for edge localization [7, 9]. Convolution of an image with a laplacian kernel approximates the 2nd partial derivative of the image. The laplacian image zero-crossing corresponds to points of maximal (or minimal) gradient magnitude. Thus, laplacian zero-crossings represent “good” edge properties and should therefore have a low local cost. If IL(q) is the laplacian of an image I at pixel q, then

However, application of a discrete laplacian kernel to a digital image produces very few zero-valued pixels. Rather, a zero-cross- ing is represented by two neighboring pixels that change from pos- itive to negative. Of the two pixels, the one closest to zero is used to represent the zero-crossing. The resulting feature cost contains single-pixel wide cost “canyons” used for boundary localization.

Since the laplacian zero-crossing creates a binary feature, fZ(q) does not distinguish between strong, high gradient edges and weak, low gradient edges.

Links are either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal (relative to the position of q in p’s neighborhood) and point such that the dot prod- uct of D(p) and L(p, q) is positive, as noted in (5). The neighbor- hood link direction associates a high cost to an edge or link between two pixels that have similar gradient directions but are perpendicu- lar, or near perpendicular, to the link between them. Therefore, the direction feature cost is low when the gradient direction of the two pixels are similar to each other and the link between them.

plexity to be extracted. Second, the edge features used here are more robust and comprehensive than previous implementations: we maximize over different gradient kernels sizes to encompass the various edge types and scales while simultaneously attempting to balance edge detail with noise suppression [7], and we use the lapla- cian zero-crossing for boundary localization and ﬁne detail live- wire “snapping”. Third, the discrete, bounded nature of the local edge costs permit the use of a specialized sorting algorithm that inserts points into a sorted list (called the active list) in constant time. Fourth, the live-wire tool is free to deﬁne a goal pixel inter- actively, at any “free” point in the image, after minimum cost paths are computed to all pixels. The latter happens fast enough that the free point almost always falls within an expanding cost wavefront and interactivity is not impeded.

Notice that since the active list is sorted, when a new, lower cumu- lative cost is computed for a pixel already on the list then that point must be removed from the list in order to be added back to the list with the new lower cost. Similar to adding a point to the sorted list, this operation is also performed in constant time.

Figure 1 demonstrates the use of the 2-D DP graph search algo- rithm to create a minimum cumulative cost path map (with corre- sponding optimal path pointers). Figure 1(a) is the initial local cost map with the seed point circled. For simplicity of demonstration the local costs in this example are pixel based rather than link based and can be thought of as representing the gradient magnitude cost feature. Figure 1(b) shows a portion of the cumulative cost and pointer map after expanding the seed point (with a cumulative cost of zero). Notice how the diagonal local costs have been scaled by Euclidean distance (consistent with the gradient magnitude cost feature described previously). Though complicating the example, weighing by Euclidean distance is necessary to demonstrate that the cumulative costs to points currently on the active list can change if even lower cumulative costs are computed from as yet unexpanded neighbors. This is demonstrated in Figure 1(c) where two points

Notice how the points diagonal to the seed point have changed cumulative cost and direction point- ers. The Euclidean weighting between the seed and diagonal points makes them more costly than non-diagonal paths. Figures 1(d), 1(e), and 1(f) show the cumulative cost/direction pointer map at various stages of completion. Note how the algorithm produces a “wavefront” of active points emanating from the initial start point, called the seed point, and that the wavefront grows out faster where there are lower costs.

Figure 2 demonstrates how a live-wire boundary segment adapts to changes in the free point (cursor position) by latching onto more and more of an object boundary. Speciﬁcally, note the live-wire segments corresponding to user-speciﬁed free point positions at times t0, t1, and t2. Although Fig. 2 only shows live-wire segments for three discrete time instances, live-wire segments are actually updated dynamically and interactively (on-the-ﬂy) with each move- ment of the free point.

When movement of the free point causes the boundary to digress from the desired object edge, interactive input of a new seed point prior to the point of departure reinitiates the 2-D DP boundary detection. This causes potential paths to be recomputed from the new seed point while effectively “tieing off” the boundary com- puted up to the new seed point.

Since each pixel (or free point) deﬁnes only one optimal path to a seed point, a minimum of two seed points must be placed to ensure a closed object boundary. The path map from the ﬁrst seed point of every object is maintained during the course of an object’s boundary deﬁnition to provide a closing boundary path from the free point. The closing boundary segment from the free point to the ﬁrst seed point expedites boundary closure.

the boundary is forced to pass through the seed points). To facilitate seed point placement, a cursor snap is available which forces the mouse pointer to the maximum gradient magnitude pixel within a user speciﬁed neighborhood. The neighborhood can be anywhere from 1· 1 (resulting in no cursor snap) to 15· 15 (where the cursor can snap as much as 7 pixels in both x and y). Thus, as the mouse cursor is moved by the user, it snaps or jumps to a neighborhood pixel representing a “good” static edge point.

Generating closed boundaries around objects of interest can require as few as two seed points (for reasons given previously). Simple objects typically require two to ﬁve seed points but complex objects may require many more. Even with cursor snap, manual placement of seed points can be tedious and often requires a large portion of the overall boundary deﬁnition time.

Automatic seed point generation relieves the user from precise manual placement of seed points by automatically selecting a pixel on the current active boundary segment to be a new seed point. Selection is based on “path cooling” which in turn relies on path coalescence. Though a single minimum cost path exists from each pixel to a given seed point, many paths “coalesce” and share por- tions of their optimal path with paths from other pixels. Due to Bellman’s Principle of Optimality [3], if any two optimal paths from two distinct pixels share a common point or pixel, then the two paths are identical from that pixel back to the seed point. This is par- ticularly noticeable if the seed point is placed near an object edge and the free point is moved away from the seed point but remains in the vicinity of the object edge. Though a new optimal path is selected and displayed every time the mouse cursor moves, the paths are typically identical near the seed point and object edges and only change local to the free point. As the free point moves far- ther and farther away from the seed point, the portion of the active live-wire boundary segment that does not change becomes longer. New seed points are generated at the end of a stable segment (i.e., that has not changed recently). Stability is measured by time (in milliseconds) on the active boundary and path coalescence (number of times the path has been redrawn from distinct free points).

This measure of stability provides the live-wire segment with a sense of “cooling”. The longer a pixel is on a stable section of the live-wire boundary, the cooler it becomes until it eventually freezes and automatically produces a new seed point.

On occasion, a section of the desired object boundary may have a weak gradient magnitude relative to a nearby strong gradient edge. Since the nearby strong edge has a relatively lower cost, the live-wire segment snaps to the strong edge rather than the desired weaker edge. This can be seen in Fig. 4(a). The desired boundary is the woman’s (Harriet’s) cheek. However, since part of it is so close to the high contrast shoulder of the man (Ozzie), the live-wire snaps to the shoulder.

Training allows dynamic adaptation of the cost function based on a sample boundary segment. Training exploits an object’s bound- ary segment that is already considered to be good and is performed dynamically as part of the boundary segmentation process. As a result, trained features are updated interactively as an object bound- ary is being deﬁned. On-the-ﬂy training eliminates the need for a separate training phase and allows the trained feature cost functions to adapt within the object being segmented as well as between objects in the image. Fig. 4(b) demonstrates how a trained live-wire segment latches onto the edge that is similar to the previous training segment rather that the nearby stronger edge.

To facilitate training and trained cost computation, a gradient magnitude feature map or image is precomputed by scaling the min- imized gradient magnitude image, G', into an integer range of size nG (i.e., from 0 to nG - 1). The actual feature cost is determined by mapping these feature values through a look-up table which con- tains the scaled (weighted) cost for each value. Fig 4(c) illustrates edge cost based on gradient magnitude without training. Note that with training (Fig. 4(d)) edge cost plummets for gradients that are speciﬁc to the object of interest’s edges.

closest portion of the current deﬁned object boundary. A training length, t, speciﬁes how many of the most recent boundary pixels are used to generate the training statistics. A monotonically decreasing weight function (either linearly or Gaussian based) determines the contribution from each of the closestt pixels. This permits adaptive training with local dependence to prevent trained feature from being too subject to old edge characteristics. The closest pixel (i.e., the current active boundary segment endpoint) gets a weight of 1 and the point that is t pixels away, along the boundary from the cur- rent active endpoint, gets a minimal weight (which can be deter- mined by the user). The training algorithm samples the precomputed feature maps along the closestt pixels of the edge seg- ment and increments the feature histogram element by the corre- sponding pixel weight to generate a histogram for each feature involved in training.

Since training is based on learned edge characteristics from the most recent portion of an object’s boundary, training is most effec- tive for those objects with edge properties that are relatively consis- tent along the object boundary (or, if changing, at least change smoothly enough for the training algorithm to adapt). In fact, train- ing can be counter-productive for objects with sudden and/or dra- matic changes in edge features. However, training can be turned on and off interactively throughout the deﬁnition of an object bound- ary so that it can be used (if needed) in a section of the boundary with similar edge characteristics and then turned off before a drastic change occurs.

Interactive optimal 2-D path selection is what makes Intelligent Scissors work and is the key difference between Intelligent Scissors and all previous techniques. Snakes are interactively initialized with an approximate boundary contour (often requiring several manually placed points); this single contour is then iteratively adjusted in an attempt to minimize an energy functional. The live- wire tool, on the other hand, is interactively initialized with just a single seed point and it then generates, at interactive speeds, all pos- sible optimal paths from the seed point to every other point in the image, thus, allowing the user to interactively select the desired optimal boundary segment. As a result, Intelligent Scissors typi- cally require less time and effort to segment an object than it takes to manually input an initial approximation to the object boundary.

As mentioned, composition artists need an intelligent, interactive tool to facilitate image component boundary deﬁnition. Since Intel- ligent Scissors can quickly segment object from an image, it serves as a tool for cut and paste operations. After object boundaries have been extracted, object can be copied from the image and placed into a buffer (i.e., clipboard) for future processing and placement into another image, or the same image if desired.

The cut object can be transformed--i.e., rotated, scaled, and trans- lated, (RST)--before combination with the destination image. This is done using an interactive graphical tool with “handles” for RST control. The tool speciﬁes a 2-D RST transformation matrix, M. The source image is then bilinearly interpolated through the matrix to paste the cut object into the destination image.

Image composition often requires blending an object from one image into another image such that the cut-out object is not in the foreground. This requires the composition artist to “slip” the cut- out object behind some scene components while leaving it in front of other components. This operation can again be performed using the live-wire tool to create a composition mask1. Scene components can be cut out of an image to create a mask such that any additions or changes to the scene will not affect masked pixels.

However, subpixel accuracy can be obtained by exploiting the signed output of the laplacian opera- tor.

Since the live-wire boundary will not always correspond to a zero-crossing, jaggies can also be reduced by appropriate edge ﬁl- tering, similar to anti-aliasing. Edge ﬁltering is also desirable because real world images are acquired using ﬁnite image detectors and, as a result, pixels on or near an object boundary share informa- tion (i.e., color) from the object and the background.

One approach to edge ﬁltering is to perform a local post-smooth- ing of the image around the pasted object boundary. However, this does not account for the fact that the edge pixels of the cut object very likely contain some background information from the original image. This is most noticeable when an object is composited into a scene with a different background color than the object’s original background color. A more general solution would determine how much of each edge pixel corresponds to the actual object color and weight them accordingly when combining into another image.

Once the object of interest has been segmented from the sur- rounding background we can scale it, rotate it, color it, or paste it onto another (destination) image. When pasting, it is desirable to perform image composition “seamlessly” in order to make it believ- able. That is, we should not be able to detect where the paste occurred. However, the source and the destination images will often have differing spatial frequencies or contrast due to differ- ences in focus or lighting when the images were acquired. Thus, equivalencing of spatial frequencies and normalization of contrast is sometimes desirable in order to produce a convincing composi- tion.

Equivalencing of spatial frequencies is performed by matching the spectral content of the cut piece and the destination image in the vicinity where it is to be pasted. Convincing composition often requires the spectra of the object and the destination image to match. This is accomplished by low-pass ﬁltering the spectrum with the higher frequency content to match that of the other. The spectrum with the higher frequency content is determined by parameter ﬁtting of a Butterworth low-pass ﬁlter (BLPF) to both spectra. Parameters corresponding to the spectrum with the lower frequency content are used to low-pass ﬁlter the spectrum of the other image.

Equivalencing of spatial frequencies is performed by ﬁrst com- puting the fourier transforms, S(u, v) and I(u, v) of the source image S(x, y) and the destination image I(x, y). We then compute the log power spectra s(u, v) and i(u, v):

Figures 5, 6, and 7 show the boundaries deﬁned using Intelligent Scissors on a variety of image types. Fig. 5 is an artiﬁcial test image that exhibits gaussian edge blurring and point noise typical of some imaging hardware. Fig. 6 is the desktop scene used in Figures 2 and 3. Fig. 7 (a CT image of a lumbar spine) demonstrates the live- wire’s application to medical imaging. The boundary deﬁnition times (for a trained user) for each displayed object boundary are given in the caption of each respective ﬁgure.

Previously, dynamic programming approaches to boundary detection were typically computationally expensive. However, by formulating DP as a graph search and restricting the local costs to integer values within a range, the 2-D DP algorithm can take advan- tage of an O(N) sort for N points. As mentioned, adding points to the sorted active list and removing points from it requires constant time. As a result, the algorithm’s computational complexity for N image pixels is O(N). This can be seen by examining the algorithm in a worst case situation. As a pixel is removed from the active list, it is expanded by computing the cumulative cost to all of its neigh- bors that have not already been expanded. In the worst case, a pixel has its cumulative cost computed by all of its 8 neighbors, resulting in 8N cumulative cost computations for N pixels. Obviously, not every point can be expanded after all of its neighbors have. Except for the seed point, every point that has a cumulative cost must have at least one neighboring point that has already been expanded. Thus the cumulative cost is not recomputed for those neighbors. In short, it can be shown that at most only 4N cumulative cost computations are performed, resulting in an O(N) algorithm.

========================================

Content:
Intelligent Scissors provide an accurate and efﬁcient interactive tool for object extraction and image composition. In fact, and in sharp contrast to tedious manual boundary deﬁnition, object extrac- tion using the live-wire is almost as much fun as the ﬁnal result (the composition). Intelligent Scissors are intuitive to use and can be applied to existing black and white or color images of arbitrary complexity. There are many rich extensions of this work, including: (1) making use of the weighted zero-crossings in the Laplacian to perform subpixel edge ﬁltering and anti-aliasing, (2) use of multi- ple layered (multiplane) masks, (3) making spatial frequency equivalencing locally adaptive, (4) varying the light source over the object using directional gradient shading (artiﬁcial or borrowed) to provide consistent lighting in the composition, and, most impor- tantly (5) extension of the 2-D DP graph search and application of the live-wire snap and training tools to moving objects and moving, multiplane masks for composition of image sequences.

Something IMPORTANT to REMEMBER
========================================
Source: ./documents/Practicals with Solutions - Histogram (Whole Image Understanding).pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 6
Content:
Histogram equalisation is achieved by computing the cumulative density function (CDF). The CDF provides a lookup table which specifies the mapping from input to output pixel values. To complete the mapping, the selected CDF value must be scaled back into the range of the image representation. For a 3-bit (8 value) image is done by dividing the CDF value by 1/(N-1) (where N is the number of Input Pixel Value rows) and rounding the result to a single integer value. Alternatively, you may also multiply the CDF value with (N-1) directly. The output histogram is obtained by considering each possible image value and working back through the mapping to see which bins in the input histogram map to that output bin. The output normalised frequency at a given bin is the sum of the input normalised frequencies of values that map to that bin.

Abstract—After[15], [31], [19], [8], [25], [5], minimum cut/maximum flow algorithmson graphs emerged as an increasingly useful tool for exact or approximate energy minimization in low-level vision. The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scopeofcomputervision.Thegoalofthispaperis toprovideanexperimentalcomparisonoftheefficiencyofmin-cut/max flowalgorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style “push-relabel” methods and algorithms based on Ford- Fulkerson style “augmenting paths.” We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes.

GREIG et al. [15] were the first to discover that powerful min-cut/max-flow algorithms from combinatorial op- timization can be used to minimize certain important energy functions in vision. The energies addressed by Greig et al. and by most later graph-based methods (e.g., [32], [18], [4], [17], [8], [2], [30], [39], [21], [36], [38], [6], [23],

Greig et al. constructed a two terminal graph such that the minimum cost cut of the graph gives a globally optimal binary labeling L in case of the Potts model of interaction in (1). Previously, exact minimization of energies like (1) was not possible and such energies were approached mainly with iterative algorithms like simulated annealing. In fact, Greig et al. used their result to show that, in practice, simulated annealing reaches solutions very far from the global minimum even in a very simple example of binary image restoration.

where L = {L, |p € P} isa labeling of image P, D,(-) isadata penalty function, V,,, is an interaction potential, and N isa set of all pairs of neighboring pixels. An example of image labeling is shown in Fig. 1. Typically, data penalties D,(-) indicate individual label-preferences of pixels based on observed intensities and prespecified likelihood function. Interaction potentials V,, encourage spatial coherence by penalizing discontinuities between neighboring pixels. The papers above show that, to date, graph-based energy minimization methods arguably provide some of the most accurate solutions for the specified applications. For example, consider two recent evaluations of stereo algorithms using real imagery with dense ground truth [34], [37].

Unfortunately, the graph cut technique in Greig et al. remained unnoticed for almost 10 years mainly because binary image restoration looked very limited as an applica- tion. Early attempts to use combinatorial graph cut algo- rithms in vision were restricted to image clustering [40]. In the ate 1990s, a large number of new computer vision techniques appeared that figured how to use min-cut/max-flow algo- rithms on graphs for solving more interesting nonbinary roblems. Roy and Cox [32] were the first to use these algorithms to compute multicamera stereo. Later, [18], [4] showed that, with the right edge weights ona graph similar to that used in [32], one can minimize a fairly general energy unction (1) in a multilabel case with linear interaction enalties. This graph construction was further generalized to handle arbitrary convex cliques in [19]. Another general case of multilabel energies where interaction penalty is a metric (on the space of labels) was studied in [4], [8]. Their a-expansion algorithm finds provably good approximate solutions by iteratively running min-cut/max-flow algo- rithms on appropriate graphs. The case of metric interactions includes many kinds of “robust” cliques that are frequently preferred in practice.

Geometric properties of segments produced by graph- cut methods were investigated in [3]. This work studied cut metric on regular grid-graphs and showed that discrete topology of graph-cuts can approximate any continuous Riemannian metric space. The results in [3] established a link between two standard energy minimization ap- proaches frequently used in vision: combinatorial graph- cut methods and geometric methods based on level-sets (e.g., [35], [29], [33], [28]).

A growing number of publications in vision use graph- based energy minimization techniques for applications like imagesegmentation[18],[39],[21],[5],restoration[15],stereo [32], [4], [17], [23], [24], [9], shape reconstruction [36], object recognition[2],augmentedreality[38],texturesynthesis[26], and others. The graphs corresponding to these applications are usually huge 2D or 3D grids and min-cut/max-flow algorithm efficiency is an issue that cannot be ignored.

In this section, we review some basic facts about graphs in e context of energy minimization methods in vision. A irected weighted (capacitated) graph G = (V, €) consists of set of nodes V and a set of directed edges € that connect em. Usually, the nodes correspond to pixels, voxels, or ther features. A graph normally contains some additional pecial nodes that are called terminals. In the context of ision, terminals correspond to the set of labels that can be ssigned to pixels. We will concentrate on the case of graphs with two terminals. Then, the terminals are usually called the source, s, and the sink, t. In Fig. 2a, we show a simple example of a two terminal graph (due to Greig et al. [15]) that can be used to minimize the Potts case of energy (1) on a3 x 3 image with two labels. There is some variation in the structure of graphs used in other energy minimization methods in vision. However, most of them are based on regular 2D or 3D grid graphs such as the one in Fig. 2a. This is a simple consequence of the fact that, normally, graph nodes represent regular image pixels or voxels. <2onfr7 OF 2

The main goal of this paper is to experimentally compare the running time of several min-cut/max-flow algorithms on graphs typical for applications in vision. In Section 2, we provide basic facts about graphs, min-cut and max-flow problems, and some standard combinatorial optimization algorithms for them. We consider both Goldberg-Tarjan style push-relabel algorithms [14] as well as methods based on augmenting paths a la Ford-Fulkerson [13]. Note that, in the course of our experiments with standard augmenting path techniques, we developed some new algorithmic ideas that significantly boosted empirical performance on grid- graphs in vision. Section 3 describes our new min-cut/max- flow algorithm. In Section 4, we tested this new augment- ing-path style algorithm as well as three standard algo- rithms: the H_PRF and Q_PRF versions of the “push- relabel” method [14], [10] and the Dinic algorithm [12] that also uses augmenting paths. We selected several examples in image restoration, stereo, and segmentation where different forms of energy (1) are minimized via graph structures originally described in [15], [18], [4], [8], [23], [24], [6]. Such (or very similar) graphs are used in all computer vision papers known to us that use graph cut algorithms. In

All edges in the graph are assigned some weight or cost. A cost of a directed edge ðp;qÞ may differ from the cost of the reverse edge ðq;pÞ. In fact, the ability to assign different edge weights for ðp;qÞ and ðq;pÞ is important for many graph- basedapplicationsinvision.Normally,therearetwotypesof edges in the graph: n-links and t-links. N-links connect pairs of neighboring pixels or voxels. Thus, they represent a neighborhood system in the image. The cost of n-links correspondstoapenaltyfordiscontinuitybetweenthepixels. These costs are usually derived from the pixel interaction term Vp;q in energy (1). T-links connect pixels with terminals (labels). The cost of a t-link connecting a pixel and a terminal corresponds to a penalty for assigning the corresponding label to the pixel. This cost is normally derived from the data term Dp in the energy (1).

An s=t cut C on a graph with two terminals is a partitioning of the nodes in the graph into two disjoint subsets S and T such that the source s is in S and the sink t is in T . For simplicity, throughout this paper, we refer to s=t cuts as just cuts. Fig. 2b shows one example of a cut. In combinatorial optimization, the cost of a cut C ¼ fS;T g is defined as the

As usual, the cost of edges between the pixels (graph nodes) is set to low values in places with high intensity contrast. Thus, cuts along object boundaries in the image should be cheaper. Weak edges also work as “bottlenecks” for a flow. In (b), we show a maximum flow from s to t. In fact, it saturates graph edges corresponding to a minimum cut boundary in (c). (a) Original image.

One of the fundamental results in combinatorial optimi- zation is that the minimum s=t cut problem can be solved by finding a maximum flow from the source s to the sink t. Loosely speaking, maximum flow is the maximum “amount of water” that can be sent from the source to the sink by interpreting graph edges as directed “pipes” with capacities equal to edge weights. The theorem of Ford and Fulkerson [13] states that a maximum flow from s to t saturates a set of edges in the graph dividing the nodes into two disjoint parts fS;T g corresponding to a minimum cut. Thus, min-cut and max-flow problems are equivalent. In fact, the maximum flow value is equal to the cost of the minimum cut. The “duality” relationship between maximum flow and mini- mum cut problems is illustrated in Fig. 3 in the context of image segmentation. Max-flow displayed in Fig. 3a saturates the edges in the min-cut boundary in Fig. 3b.

We can intuitively show how min-cut (or max-flow) on a graph may help with energy minimization over image labelings. Consider an example in Fig. 2. The graph corresponds to a 3 x 3 image. Any s/t cut partitions the nodes into disjoint groups each containing exactly one terminal. Therefore, any cut corresponds to some assign- ment of pixels (nodes) to labels (terminals). If edge weights are appropriately set based on parameters of an energy, a minimum cost cut will correspond to a labeling with the minimum value of this energy.”

An important fact in combinatorial optimization is that there are polynomial algorithms for min-cut/max-flow problems on directed weighted graphs with two terminals. Most of the algorithms belong to one of the following two groups: Goldberg-Tarjan style “push-relabel” methods [14] and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style “augmenting paths” [13].

Standard augmenting paths-basedalgorithms, such as the Dinic algorithm [12], work by pushing flow along non- saturated paths from the source to the sink until the maximum flow in the graph G is reached. A typical augmenting path algorithm stores information about the distribution of the current s ! t flow f among the edges of G using a residual graph Gf. The topology of Gf is identical to G, but the capacity of an edge in Gf reflects the residual capacity of the same edge in G given the amount of flow already in the edge. At the initialization, there is no flow from the source to the sink (f = 0) and edge capacities in the residual graph G0 are equal to the original capacities in G. At each new iteration, the algorithm finds the shortest s ! t path along nonsaturated edges of the residual graph. If a path is found, then the algorithm augments it by pushing the maximum possible flow df that saturates at least one of the edges in the path. The residual capacities of edges in the path are reduced by df while the residual capacities of the reverse edges are increased by df. Each augmentation increases the total flow from the source to the sink f ¼ f þ df. The maximum flow is reached when any s ! t path crosses at least one saturated edge in the residual graph Gf.

The Dinic algorithm uses breadth-first search to find the shortest paths from s to t on the residual graph Gf. After all shortest paths of a fixed length k are saturated, algorithm starts the breadth-first search for s ! t paths of length k þ 1 from scratch. Note that the use of shortest paths is an important factor that improves theoretical running time complexities for algorithms based on augmenting paths. The worst-case running time complexity for the Dinic algorithm is Oðmn2Þ, where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges in the graph. the

Push-relabel algorithms [14] use quite a different approach. They do not maintain a valid flow during the operation; there are “active” nodes that have a positive “flow excess.” Instead, the algorithms maintain a labeling of nodes giving a low bound estimate on the distance to the sink along nonsaturated edges. The algorithms attempt to “push” excess flows toward nodes with smaller estimated distance to the sink. Typically, the “push” operation is applied to active nodes with the largest distance (label) or based on FIFO selection strategy. The distances (labels) progressively increase as edges are saturated by push operations. Undeliverable flows are eventually drained back to the source. We recommend our favorite textbook on basic graph theory and algorithms [11] for more details on push-relabel and augmenting path methods.

Note that the most interesting applications of graph cuts to vision use directed N-D grids with locally connected nodes. It is also typical that a large portion of the nodes is connected to the terminals. Unfortunately, these conditions rule out many specialized min-cut/max-flow algorithms that are designed for some restricted classes of graphs. Examples of interesting but inapplicable methods include randomized techniques for dense undirected graphs [20], methods for planar graphs assuming small number of terminal connections [27], [16], and others.

Normally, see Section 2.2, augmenting path-based methods start a new breadth-first search for s ! t paths as soon as all paths of a given length are exhausted. In the context of graphs in computer vision, building a breadth-first search tree typically involves scanning the majority of image pixels. Practically speaking, it could be a very expensive operation if it has to be performed too often. Indeed, our real-data experiments in vision confirmed that rebuilding a search tree on graphs makes standard augmenting path techniques perform poorly in practice. We developed several ideas that improved empirical performance of augmenting path techniques on graphs in computer vision.

At the growth stage, the search trees expand. The active nodes explore adjacent nonsaturated edges and acquire new children from a set of free nodes. The newly acquired nodes become active members of the corresponding search trees. As soon as all neighbors of a given active node are explored, the active node becomes passive. The growth stage terminates if an active node encounters a neighboring node that belongs to the opposite tree. In this case, we detect a path from the source to the sink, as shown in Fig. 4.

The new min-cut/max-flow algorithm presented here belongs to the group of algorithms based on augmenting paths.Similarto Dinic[12],itbuildssearchtreesfor detecting augmenting paths. In fact, we build two search trees, one from the source and the other from the sink.3 The other differenceisthatwereusethesetreesandneverstartbuilding them from scratch. The drawback of our approach is that the augmenting paths found are not necessarily shortest aug- menting path; thus, the time complexity of the shortest augmenting path is no longer valid. The trivial upper bound on the number of augmentations for our algorithm is the cost of the minimum cut jCj, which results in the worst-case complexity Oðmn2jCjÞ. Theoretically speaking, this is worse thanthecomplexitiesofthestandardalgorithmsdiscussedin Section 2.2. However, experimental comparison in Section 4 shows that, on typical problem instances in vision, our algorithm significantly outperforms standard algorithms.

The augmentation stage augments the path found at the growth stage. Since we push through the largest flow possible, some edge(s) in the path become saturated. Thus, some of the nodes in the trees S and T may become “orphans,” that is, the edges linking them to their parents are no longer valid (they are saturated). In fact, augmentation phase may split the search trees S and T into forests. The source s and the sink t are still roots of two of the trees, while orphans form roots of all other trees. the

The goal of the adoption stage is to restore the single-tree structureofsetsS andT withrootsinthe sourceandthesink. At this stage, we try to find a new valid parent for each orphan.Anewparentshouldbelongtothesameset,S orT,as the orphan. A parent should also be connected through a nonsaturated edge. If there is no qualifying parent, we remove the orphan from S or T and make it a free node. We also declare all its former children orphans. The stage terminates when no orphans are left and, thus, the search tree structures of S and T are restored. Since some orphan nodes in S and T may become free, the adoption stage results in contraction of these sets.

After the adoption stage is completed, the algorithm returns to the growth stage.

If node p belongs to one of the search trees, then the information about its parent will be stored as PARENTðpÞ. Roots of the search trees (the source and the sink), orphans, and all free nodes have no parents, i.e., PARENTðpÞ ¼ ;. We will also use notation tree capðp ! qÞ to describe the residual capacity of either edge ðp;qÞ if TREEðpÞ ¼ S or edge ðq;pÞ if TREEðpÞ ¼ T. These edges should be nonsaturated in order for node p to be a valid parent of its child q depending on the search tree.

The operation “process p” consists of the following steps: First, we are trying to find a new valid parent for p among its neighbors. A valid parent q should satisfy: TREEðqÞ ¼ TREEðpÞ, tree capðq ! pÞ > 0, and the “origin” of q should be either source or sink. Note that the last condition is necessary because, during the adoption stage, some of the nodes in the search trees S or T may originate from orphans.

The proof of correctness of the algorithm presented above is straightforward (see [22]). At the same time, our description leaves many free choices in implementing certain details. For example, we found that the order of processing active nodes and orphans may have a significant effect on the algorithm’s running time. Our preferred processing method is a minor variation of “First-In-First-Out.” In this case, the growth stage can be described as a breadth-first search. This guarantees that at least the first path from the source to the sink is the shortest. Note that the search tree may change unpredictably during the adoption stage. Thus, we cannot guarantee anything about paths found after the first one.

We used a fixed tuning of our algorithm in all experiments of Section 4. Complete details of this tuning can be found in [22]. A library with our implementation is available upon request for research purposes. The general goal of tuning was to make augmenting paths as short as possible. Note that augmenting paths on graphs in vision can be easily visualized. In the majority of cases, such graphs are regular grids of nodes that correspond to image pixels. Then, augmenting paths and the whole graph flow can be meaningfully displayed (e.g., Fig. 3b). We can also display the search trees at different stages. This allows a very intuitive way of tuning max-flow methods in vision.

In this section, we experimentally test min-cut/max-flow algorithms for three different applications in computer vision: image restoration (Section 4.2), stereo (Section 4.3), and object segmentation (Section 4.4). We chose formula- tions where certain appropriate versions of energy (1) can be minimized via graph cuts. The corresponding graph structures were previously described by [15], [18], [4], [8], [23], [24], [5] in detail. These (or very similar) structures are used in all computer vision applications with graph cuts (that we are aware of) to date.

Image restoration is a representative early vision problem. The goal is to restore original pixel intensities from the observed noisy data. Some examples of image restoration are shown in Fig. 5. The problem can be very easily formulated in terms of energy (1) minimization. In fact, many other low-level vision problems can be represented by the same energies. We chose the context of image restoration mainly for its simplicity.

In this section, we consider two examples of energy (1) based on the Potts and linear models of interaction, correspondingly. Besides image restoration [15], graph methods for minimizing Potts energy were used in segmen- tation [21], stereo [4], [8], object recognition [2], shape reconstruction [36], and augmented reality [38]. Linear interaction energies were used in stereo [32] and segmenta- tion [18]. Minimization of the linear interaction energy is basedon graphs that are quite different from what is used for thePottsmodel.Atthesametime,thereisverylittlevariation between the graphs in different applications when the same type of energy is used. They mainly differ in their specific edge cost settings while the topological properties of graphs are almost identical once the energy model is fixed.

In fact, the algorithm finds an optimal subset of pixels that gives the largest decrease in the energy. The computation is done via graph cuts using some generalization of the basic graph structure in [15] (see Fig. 2). The algorithm repeatedly cycles through all possible labels a until no further improvement is possible.

Fig. 7. Running times for “multilayered” graphs (e.g., [31], [19]). as functions of image size. The results results are obtained in the context of image restoration with linear interaction potentials (see Section 4.2.2). Here, we fixed the number of allowed labels (graph layers) and tested the empirical complexities of min-cut/max-flow algorithms with respect to image size. Images of smaller size were obtained by subsampling. The running time plots are presented in logarithmic scale where the empirical complexities of algorithms can be estimated from slopes of each plot. Dashed lines provide references for linear and quadratic growth slopes. All max-flow/min-cut algorithms gave near-linear (with respect to image size) performance in these experiments.

Table 2 shows the running times (in seconds on 1.4 GHz, Pentium IV) that different min-cut/max-flow algorithms took to compute the exact minimum of the linear interac- tions energy (3). We used the same Diamond and Bell Quad images as in the Potts energy tests. We run the algorithms on images at different resolution. At each column, we state the exact size (height and width) in pixels. Note that the total number of pixels increases by a factor of two from left to right. Also, see Figs. 7a and 7b for logarithmic scale plots.

Our experiments with linear interaction graphs show that most of the tested max-flow/min-cut algorithms are close to linear both with respect to increase in image size and in the number of labels. At the same time, none of the algorithms behaved linearly with respect to the number of labels despite the fact that the size of graphs linearly depends on the number of labels. Our algorithm is a winner in absolute speed as, in most of the tests, it is 2-4 times faster than the second best method. However, our algorithm’s dynamics with respect to increase in the number of labels is not favorable. For example, Q_PRF gets very close to the speed of our method in case of L ¼ 250 (Bell Quad) even though our algorithm was two times faster than Q_PRF when the number of labels was L ¼ 32.

Stereo is another classical vision problem where graph- based energy minimization methods have been successfully applied. The goal of stereo is to compute the correspon- dence between pixels of two or more images of the same scene obtained by cameras with slightly different view points. We consider three graph-based methods for solving this problem: pixel-labeling stereo with the Potts model [4], [8], stereo with occlusions [23], and multicamera scene reconstruction [24]. Note that the last method is designed

performance of different max-flow/min-cut algorithms is very similar when the energy minimization is run to convergence, while the number of cycles it takes to converge varies between three and five for different data sets. We performed two sets of experiments: one with a four-neighborhood system and the other with an eight- neighborhood system. The corresponding running times are marked by “N4” and “N8.” The disparity maps at convergence are shown in Figs. 9b, 9e, and 9h. The convergence results are slightly better than the results after the first cycle of iterations. We obtained very similar disparity maps in the N4 and N8 cases.

Any stereo images of multidepth objects contain occluded pixels. The presence of occlusions adds significant technical difficulties to the problem of stereo as the space of solutions needs to be constrained in a very intricate fashion. Most stereo techniques ignore the issue to make the problem tractable. Inevitably, such simplification can generate errors that range from minor inconsistencies to major misinterpre- tation of the scene geometry. Recently, [1] reported some progress in solving stereo with occlusions. Ishikawa and Geiger [17] were first to suggest a graph-cut-based solution for stereo that elegantly handles occlusions assuming monotonicity constraint.

In this section, we compare the running times of the selected min-cut/max-flow algorithms in case of an object extraction technique [5] using appropriately constrained N- D grid-graphs.6 The method in [5] can be applied to objects of interest in images or volumes of any dimension. This technique generalizes the MAP-MRF method of Greig et al. [15] by incorporating additional contextual constraints into minimization of the Potts energy

In particular, some hard constraints may come directly from a user (object and background seeds). As shown in [3], graph construction in [5] can be generalized to find geodesics and minimum surfaces in Riemannian metric spaces. This result links graph-cut segmentation methods with popular geometric techniques based on level-sets [35], [29], [33], [28].

The technique in [5] finds a globally optimal binary segmentation of N-dimensional image under appropriate constraints. The computation is done in one pass of a max- flow/min-cut algorithm on a certain graph. In case of 2D images, the structure of the underlying graph is exactly the same as shown in Fig. 2. In 3D cases, [5] build a regular 3D grid graph.

Figs. 11a and 11b shows one of our experiments where a group of people around a bell were segmented ona real photo image (255 x 313 pixels). Other segmentation examples in Figs. 11c, 11d, 11e, 11f, 11g,and 11hare for 2D and 3D medical data. In Figs. 11c and 11d, we segmented a left ventricle in 3D cardiac MR data (127 x 127 x 12 voxels). In our 3D experiments, the seeds were placed in one slice in the middle of the volume. Often, this is enough to segment the whole volume correctly. The tests with lung CT data (Figs. 1le and 11f) were made in the 2D (409 x 314 pixels) case. The goal was to segment out a lower lung lobe. In Figs. 11g and 11h, we tested the algorithms on the 2D liver MR data (511 x 511 pixels). Additional 3D experiments were per- formed on heart ultrasound and kidney MR volumes.

Table 7 compares running times (in seconds, 1.4 GHz Pentium IV) of the selected min-cut/max-flow algorithms for a number of segmentation examples. Note that these times include only min-cut/max-flow computation.7 In each column, we show running times of max-flow/min- cut algorithms corresponding to exactly the same set of seeds. The running times were obtained for the “6” and “26” neighborhood systems (N6 and N26). Switching from N6 to N26 increases the complexity of graphs but does not affect the quality of segmentation results much.

We tested a reasonable sample of typical vision graphs. In most examples, our new min-cut/max-flow algorithm worked 2-5 times faster than any of the other methods, including the push-relabel and the Dinic algorithms (which are known to outperform other min-cut/max-flow techni- ques). In some cases, the new algorithm made possible near real-time performance of the corresponding applications.

More specifically, we can conclude that our algorithm is consistently several times faster (than the second best method) in all applications where graphs are 2D grids. However, our algorithm is not a clear outperformer when the complexity of underlying graphs is increased. For example, linear interaction energy graphs (Section 4.2.2) with a large number of grid-layers (labels) is one example where Q_PRF performance was comparable to our algorithm. Similarly, experiments in Section 4.4 show that push-relabel methods (H_PRF and Q_PRF) are compar- able to our algorithm in 3D segmentation tests even though it was several times faster in all 2D segmentation examples. Going from the “6” neighborhood system to the “26” system further decreased relative performance of our method in 3D segmentation.

In fact, additional experiments showed that our algorithm is, by several orders of magnitude, slower than Q_PRF, H_PRF, and DINIC on several standard (outside computer vision) types of graphs commonly used for tests in the combinatorial optimization community.

1. Structuring Element
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 5.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
Morphological operations require an input binary image and a structuring element. Structuring elements vary in shape and size, similar to filter masks used in spatial filtering. You can create structuring elements using getStructuringElement:

2. Dilation
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 5.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
Dilation is a morphological operation which expands the foreground using a structuring element. This is done by expanding the boundary of the foreground, which in turn closes the gaps between regions. The amount and direction of expansion are based on the chosen structuring element.

3. Erosion
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 5.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
Erosion is the opposite of dilation, where the boundary of the foreground is shrunk instead, or it can also be thought of as performing dilation on the background. It is used to separate touching objects or remove small noise components.

4. Opening
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 5.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
Opening is a morphological operation which involves performing erosion on an image and then performing dilation. It helps smooth the contours of the foreground and removes small unwanted components.
========================================

Content:
● Read in the Cells.png image from Moodle. (Note: The image is a colour image, you will need to convert it to binary first. Ensure that the cells are the foreground.)
========================================

You are provided with a fingerprint image, but it is contaminated with noise. Your mission impossible task is to reduce the noise and provide a clean enhanced image of the fingerprint so that the forensic team can reliably use it in their investigation (as how you normally see on the CSI TV show). Make sure you understand and can explain your results.

Thresholding commonly produces a binary image with pixel values of either 0 (black) or 255 (white). Binary images are often used in image processing for edge detection and segmentation. To obtain a binary image, thresholding must take place. Figure 2 shows the binarized image obtained from performing thresholding on Figure 1.

Thresholding classifies the pixels in an image to either foreground or background based on the intensity values of the pixels. The pixel values of the image are set to either 0 or 255, depending on if it is above or below the decided threshold value. Using the some text.png image from the Moodle page:

Content:
- Sometimes called Interpixel Redundancy - Neighbouring pixels often have similar values - Compression based on spatial redundancy involves some element of pixel grouping or transformation - Simplest is Run-Length Encoding • Maps the pixels along each scan line into a sequence of pairs (g1, r1), (g2, r2), …, • Where gj is the ith grey level, rj is the run length of ith run

- The algorithm systematically places nodes representing high probability symbols   further up the tree: their paths (and so codes) are shorter  - No code is prefix to any other – don’t need to mark boundaries between nodes  • e.g., 01101010 must be a1a3  In this example  • Average length of the code is 2.2 bits/symbol  • The entropy of the source is 2.14 bits/symbol  In general  • Break image into small (e.g., 8 x 8) blocks  • Each block is a symbol to be encoded

- Run-length encoding needs adjacent pixels to be equal - Pixels are more often highly correlated (dependent) • Not equal, but can predict the image pixels to be coded from those already coded - Each pixel value (except at the boundaries) is predicted based on its neighbours (e.g., linear combination) to get a predicted image - The difference between the original and predicted images yields a differential or residual image with a reduced set of values - The differential image is encoded using Huffman coding, or similar

COMP2032 Laboratory Sheet 6: Edge Detection and Hough Transform
========================================

File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
1. Edge Detection
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 6.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
OpenCV provides many types of edge detection algorithms and functions, including the ones discussed in the lectures (e.g., Sobel, Roberts). Each edge detection method provides slightly different results, and the key to successful edge detection is a good choice of parameters rather than the method choice.
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 6.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
Note: The images should be converted to grayscale before performing any of the following edge detection methods. Make sure to consider all the parameters of each edge detection function: what it is and its effect on the resulting image.

1st Derivative: Sobel
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 6.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
Sobel edge detection works by identifying areas with significant intensity changes as edges. This is done by calculating the gradient in both the x and y directions individually and then combining them to calculate the magnitude of the gradient at that specific pixel. Pixels with a high magnitude are then classified as an edge.

● By using the Sobel function, tweak the parameters and show the results of applying the Sobel operator in the x direction, y direction and the combination of both x and y. (Hint: Use the formula in the lecture to compute the gradient and remember to normalise the result.)

● Compare the differences in the resulting image. (Note: The resulting image will have both positive and negative values. Use NumPy’s absolute function when displaying the image to ensure only positive values remain.)

2nd Derivative: Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 6.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) edge detection involves two steps: Gaussian smoothing and Laplacian filtering. Gaussian smoothing reduces the noise in the image, and the Laplacian filter identifies areas with significant intensity changes. LoG then identifies the zero crossings (value changes from positive to negative and vice versa) in the resulting image as edges.

Content:
● Using the Opera house.jpeg image, apply Gaussian blur and then perform LoG edge detection on the blurred image using Laplacian.

Canny
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 6.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 2
Content:
Canny edge detection can be said to be an extension of Sobel edge detection. The first step is to reduce the noise in the image by using Gaussian smoothing before calculating the gradient using Sobel filters in both the x and y. To obtain thin edges, non-maximum suppression is performed by saving only the local maximums of the gradient in the gradient direction.
========================================

Content:
Lastly, hysteresis thresholding selects the edges by using two threshold values (min and max). Edges above the max threshold are edges, edges below the min threshold are non- edges, and for edges in between the two thresholds, it is dependent on their connectivity to an edge/non-edge.

2. Hough Transform
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 6.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 2
Content:
Hough Transform is a technique used to detect shapes (e.g., lines, circles) which can be represented by mathematical equations. This is done by converting the image space into a parameter space and conducting a “voting” procedure on the points which are part of the edges in the image.

The first row shows the original images with superimposed user input (red rectangle). The second row displays all user interactions: red (background brush), white (foreground brush) and yellow (matting brush). The degree of user interaction increases from left to right. The results obtained by GrabCut are visualised in the third row. The last row shows zoomed portions of the respective result which documents that the recovered alpha mattes are smooth and free of background bleeding.

Content:
A normalised histogram is a discrete function   P(rk) = nk /n  Where:  -  N = width x height is the total number of pixels in the image  - The bins in a normalised histogram sum to 1.0  - Each bin gives the probability of the corresponding grey level appearing in the   image  - The probabilistic interpretation is valuable in e.g., contrast enhancement and   automatic thresholding  REMEMBER

Content:
OpenCV is an open-source library of functions related to computer vision, image processing and machine learning. Some other notable libraries would be Pillow (PIL) and sci-kit image. In this module, we will be using OpenCV as the main image processing library. You may read the official documentation to better understand the functions available https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html.

1. Using Libraries
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 1A.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
To use the libraries in Python, they must be imported using import. It is encouraged and good practice to import libraries at the beginning of the file. import is used to access the code in a Python module, which is a Python file containing a set of functions and classes (essentially what a library is). We can also create our own modules to organise code by grouping it, improving code readability and reusability.

NOTE: Images read in Python are arrays of type uint8, which range from 0 to 255. Some operations can generate large or negative numbers that cause overflows. You may find it useful to convert to int or float before applying some processes. When you use the imshow and imwrite functions, please pay attention to the data type as it must be of type uint8. This can be achieved by using astype to convert the data type.

COMP2032 Laboratory Sheet 3: Linear & Non-Linear Filtering
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 3.pdf

The noise reduction methods discussed in the last lecture are all based on the idea of spatial filtering, and as discussed, there are two types of filtering: linear and non-linear.

1. Linear Filtering
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 3.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
Linear filtering is done using convolution, whereby a linear filter is slid over every pixel in the image and multiplication/addition operations are performed. The output of each pixel is the weighted sum of the neighbouring pixels. We will explore two types of linear filters, which are mean filtering and Gaussian filtering. The Moodle page contains a version of the cameraman image where salt and pepper noise has been added. Using that image, apply the several types of filters to reduce the noise as much as possible.

● Use GaussianBlur to perform Gaussian filtering with sigma values of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5. Remember that you will need to vary the size of the mask as you change the Gaussian parameter. Refer to the lecture notes for guidance on mask size.

2. Non-Linear Filtering
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 3.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
Non-linear filtering, on the other hand, is done without convolution. Instead, a non-linear mathematical operation is performed on each pixel independently based on the neighbouring pixel values, resulting in the output pixel value. The three non-linear filters we will explore are median filtering, anisotropic diffusion and bilateral filtering.

● Use anisotropicDiffusion to perform anisotropic diffusion and understand the parameters in the function. Try experimenting with the parameter values: alpha (0.01 – 0.1), K (0 – 100) and with iterations of 1, 2 and 3. Compare the effects of changing the parameter values.
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 3.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
● Use bilateralFilter to perform bilateral filtering and understand the parameters. Try experimenting with the parameter values d (1 – 100) and sigma (50 – 250). You may keep both sigma values the same for simplicity’s sake. Compare the effects of changing the parameter values.
========================================

● Compare the differences between all the filters. Which filter performed the best?
========================================
Source: ./documents/Lab 3.pdf
File Type: pdf
Page Number: 1
Content:
It is good to note that different filters perform better in different scenarios as it is dependent on the image used. The type of noise in the image, the image content and the details you intend to preserve play an important role in choosing which filter is the best. Hence, it is always best to experiment with different filters to see which produced the required result.

We will be using the Matplotlib library to create and display the histograms of the images. Matplotlib is a data visualisation and plotting library for Python which contains functions similar to the ones in MATLAB. Install the Matplotlib library and import it using from matplotlib import pyplot as plt as only the pyplot module is needed. This is the official documentation for the pyplot module https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/pyplot_summary.html.

Colour images are read and stored as 3D NumPy, and the indexing scheme is image[row, column, colour]. Please note that OpenCV reads images in BGR rather than RGB, so the colours are arranged in B, G, R order.

The gamma value specifies the shape of the curve that maps the intensity values 𝐼 to create 𝑂 (see Figure 1). If gamma is less than 1, the mapping is weighted towards brighter output values. If gamma is greater than 1, the mapping is weighted towards darker output values. If gamma is equal to 1, the mapping is linear, and there is no correction.

The effects of gain and bias adjustment can be observed through the histograms of the image. Histograms are commonly used in image processing to view the properties of an image and the effects of image processing techniques. We will explore more on histograms in Lab 3. Changing the bias shifts the image’s histogram but maintains its shape while changing the gain stretches the histogram in the x-direction and flattens it (Figure 3).

- If the current pixel is foreground, there are 3 cases: 1. left = top = background → assign current pixel a new label 2. one of left and top is background, the other foreground → assign current pixel the foreground pixel’s label 3. Left = top = foreground → assign current pixel one of their labels and note that their labels are equal in an equivalence table - Step 3 detects mergers between two previously separate components
